                <p>This engine takes the company’s ticker (for publicly traded companies) as the argument. It passes the
                    ticker onto the finance module to retrieve up to date information related to the
                    income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement. It then stores this data in data
                    frames for
                    easy analysis.</p>

                <p>If needed, it can take the data frame information and extract specific data that can be used
                    to calculate the liquidity, margins and cash flow generation of the company in question, outputting
                    the informationinto an excel sheet.</p>
