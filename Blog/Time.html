            <p>Lately I’ve been wondering whether my decision to invest into the stock market was a mistake. I was
                having a
                conversation with my mom on a prospective land investment, where I had to tell her that I wasn’t as
                liquid
                as
                she thought I was. She was mildly shocked when I revealed to her what amount I had in the stock market.
                Long
                story short, about 80% of my net worth, as of today, is in the stock market. This brought back some of
                the
                fears
                that I’ve been battling with over the last couple of months. Was I making a mistake committing so much
                money
                to
                investing? Was I making the right investments? Would it be worth it? Could I lose all my money. These
                worries
                are greatly amplified by the fact that the markets have been in a downturn basically from the moment I
                got
                in.
                But then we touched on an investment they had made, and forgotten, a long time ago. and honestly, it
                served
                to
                reaffirm my conviction.</p>

            <h4>Safaricom</h4>

            <p>My parents bought into Safaricom shares when it had its IPO back in 2007-2008. They bought in at around
                KES 5
                at
                the time. Safaricom’s IPO was a big thing back then. But without the knowledge and time to keep up with
                this
                investment, it went to the back burner. Whenever they talk about it, it is with slight disgust and
                disappointment. The dividends are measly - my guess is that they expected huge dividends from their
                investments.
                They almost never bother with the shareholder meetings. Its basically wasn’t a very good investment. But
                the
                numbers tell an entirely different story. I’ll try and keep this simple - hopefully this won’t be too
                boring.</p>

            <h4>The Numbers</h4>

            <p>Safaricom shares, as I’m writing this article, are trading at around KES 27 (they hit an all time high of
                KES
                44
                before the election period came up). This represents a profit of KES 22 for a single share bought. That,
                in
                percentage terms, is a growth of 440% (a return of 4.4 times the initial investment). That represents an
                annual
                return of 29.33% in simple interest, and about <a
                    href="https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/compound-interest-calculator.php"
                    target="_blank">11.8%
                    compounded</a> (speaking to
                the power of compounding). Forgive me if I’m wrong, but that is a pretty good return on investment. As
                an
                example, banks offer, at best 3% interest, and none at worst. Money market funds, offer between 8% - 10%
                return,
                before management fees (which run around 2% - real returns being 6%-10%). The conclusion being, that
                five
                shillings invested in Safaricom is probably the best five shillings they have ever spend, barring one
                other
                investment to be mentioned below.</p>

            <h4>The Time Factor</h4>

            <p>You have to consider the fact that this investment only makes sense when considered over the long term.
                In
                the
                short term, there were plenty of reasons to sell. And I mean plenty. From February to June 2009, the
                stock
                was
                selling in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/KE/XNAI/SCOM/historical-prices"
                    target="_blank">KES 2
                    range</a>. This
                represented a investment loss of about 60%. Sixty percent! Also consider the fact that form September
                2008
                to
                January 2010, the stock was below the price they had bought it for. For a period of one 15-16 months,
                they
                were
                negative. But two arguably good things happened during this period. First, they got disheartened enough
                to
                stop
                following the stock. They simply stopped caring. This led, in a funny way, to the second good thing.
                Their
                indifference resulted in them forgetting about the stock. And by forgetting about it, they were able to
                ride
                the
                highs and lows - albeit unaware - of the stock, to the present day. The bad with this is that there
                might
                have
                been opportunities to sell, such as when it was trading above KES 40. This would have represented a
                profit
                of a
                46.66% in simple interest (14.8% compounded). But opportunities to sell exist anywhere above their
                initial
                price, and would have meant selling for a way lower profit.</p>

            <h4>Land</h4>

            <p>The one better investment I mentioned above was land. And the return on this are pretty astronomical. The
                gains
                sit at around 1,233% (12.3 times their initial investment; 68.5% in annual simple interest; <a
                    href="https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/compound-interest-calculator.php"
                    target="_blank">15.5%
                    compounded</a>). That just
                blows my mind. Now there are disadvantages to land - it takes time to close a deal whether you are
                buying or
                selling, making it very illiquid - but for someone in their twenties, with no immediate need for cash,
                it
                makes
                for a pretty compelling investment choice. We’re at a point in Kenya where more and more people want to
                have
                a
                title deed. Something in their name. The demand - and prices - for land will only go up with time. If
                you
                can,
                buy land. Don’t wait for a market crash. The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain
                solvent.</p>

            <h4>So…</h4>

            <p>What I realized is that I may be a little too focused on the short term. I’ve been investing in the stock
                market
                for about 11 months now. And while it has been a pretty bad 11 months, maybe I need to employ the same
                mentality
                as my parents. Buy and forget. In 20 years time, who knows what those investments will be worth. This
                dip
                may
                look completely inconsequential in 2042 - provided I’m still around then. But one thing’s for sure. I
                have
                time
                on my side. So I’m going to use it. The only difference in strategy is that I’m going to continue dollar
                cost
                averaging in, instead of one time buying. Hopefully I’m good at identifying long-living companies from
                the
                vast
                haystack of companies out there. But only time will tell.</p>
