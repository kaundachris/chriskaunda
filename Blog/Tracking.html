        <p><em class="intro">Financial discipline is one of the hardest things to get into.</em></p>

        <p>Financial discipline. One of the hardest things to get into and maintain. We live in an increasingly
            consumerist
            society where we buy stuff that isn't very useful (and some that is very wasteful). We do this for a wide
            variety of reasons, key among then being prestige and lifestyle. The result? People living from paycheck to
            paycheck, and looking fly doing it. But what happens when a crisis like Covid comes along and obliterates
            everything? What happens when the cashflow doesn't come in for a month. Just a month.</p>

        <h4>Situation As Is</h4>

        <p>See, I'm 26 years old, I live with my parents (still), and I have very little I can call my own. I have a
            job,
            and the first thought that comes with that 'stable' salary is to move out. But I realized that if I did
            that,
            then I'd be living on scraps (pay is pitiable), and I'd eventually have to ask for help from my parents just
            to
            meet the rent. I don't want that. I want to move out definitively. And that requires having a sizable
            emergency
            fund. hence my interest in financial discipline. What I know about finances is that they are hard to control
            precisely. But it can be done. And once it is, it becomes a habit. It becomes easier. It becomes an
            obsession.
            I've been looking into literature on this topic a lot lately. A lot of the information out there is too much
            to
            take in. Some of it, though, is simple enough to follow, and is based on principles I'm already familiar
            with.
            So I decided to go the simple route. Here's how its going.</p>

        <h4>Track Everything</h4>

        <p>Expense tracking. That's the method I've decided to use to increase my financial discipline. When i came
            across
            it, the argument was that it is easier to track and cut out items when you can see the items. It is also
            important in illuminating those small miscellaneous costs that add up really quickly over the course of a
            month.
            For me though, this tactic made sense because of two reasons: The Charlie Munger policy of 'Invert, always
            invert'; and the psychology of the habit loop.</p>

        <p>Charlie Munger (Warren's famous partner) preaches that inversion is one of the best ways to avoiding costly
            mistakes. Under this system, you do not focus on the positive aspects you want to encourage. Rather, you
            look at
            the negative aspects, whether that be behavior or outcomes, that you would want to avoid at all costs. Once
            you
            have established these factors, you figure out solutions to them. I have tried to control my spending by
            focusing on the things I really want and still ended up way over targets I'd set for myself. There were
            always
            unexplained holes every month. Money that couldn't be easily explained. Couple this with the stupid
            decisions
            you make thinking you have the cashflow, only to have it come back to bite you later. The mental energy it
            takes
            to stop yourself from spending is too strong. These companies spend money convincing you to buy their
            products.
            They know they'll recoup it tenfold. They know their persuasion works. So I decided to invert. On the first
            month of my experiment, I didn't restrict myself. I proceeded as I normally would. I bought what I normally
            do.
            There was only one change. I would write down ever single expenditure. Every. Single. Expense. And I would
            do it
            within two days of that expenditure. Simple right?</p>

        <h4>Being Conscious</h4>

        <p>Now here's the thing. Every time I was about to spend money, the thought would come that 'I will have to
            write
            this down later.' The best thing about this is that it consciously makes you actually think about that
            expense.
            Is it worth it? Do I have to? What's the value? But in my opinion, this isn't even the best part. The best
            part
            is when you sit down at the end of the month and start tallying up your expenses for that month. If you are
            faithful in this exercise, you will find that you have a humongous volume of expenses. Especially on the
            little
            things and the one off expenses you convinced yourself are okay. For me the realization was that I was
            spending
            large amount of money on food. Yet these was never food in the house. I was also paying a lot in transaction
            fees every month. Those M-pesa transaction fees build up really fast! I was also spending a considerable
            amount
            of money on one-offs. Spending money on this event, buying booze for the guys, your sister needs this. So on
            and
            so forth. That first month was eye opening.</p>

        <p>I used these figures to set targets for the next month. Since I already knew where my money goes, I could
            decide
            what stays and what doesn't. I decided not t stretch myself too far, and keep food, fare and utility
            expenses
            the same. However, I cut the miscellaneous expenses in half. The only way I was allowed to spend more on
            miscellaneous items was if I underspent in the other categories. And it worked (mostly) the following month.
            Is
            it easy to do? NO. Hell no. But it reduces the amount of mental energy and control needed to refrain
            expenses.
            Just keep track of them, and you'll be able to fill in the holes, create visibility, and basis of action.
        </p>

        <h4>Develop The Habit</h4>

        <p>The second aspect relates to a psychological aspect of behavior called a keystone habit. This is a habit
            that,
            once picked up, leads to bunch of other habits that are related and unrelated. For most people, their
            keystone
            habit is usually exercising. I can attest to the fundamental change that exercising has created in my life
            over
            the two years. How does this relate to financial discipline? Well, sitting down every two days to write down
            your expenses is not an easy thing to do. It takes a lot of mental strength to do it when you're supposed
            to.
            Its too easy to postpone doing it for a later day. In short, it takes willpower. Your ability to build the
            willpower to do this simple habit will feed into other things. Every time you want to spend, you'll have to
            think of the result (you having to sit down later to sift through the expenses). This will go a long way in
            you
            limiting your expenditures. As you sit down to record expenditures, you will have to think about every
            single
            item and its use/value over the course of that month. Slowly, you start becoming more conscious to your
            expenses, which helps to slow you down.</p>

        <h4>The Resolution</h4>

        <p>It has not been easy so far. I've come close to quitting sometimes. I had a really expensive month (my dad
            was
            in hospital), with so many little things here and there, that I considered quitting. Luckily a friend who
            does
            the same thing told me to keep on, 'for the culture.' And I did. I'm more conscious of my expenditure now.
            This
            will not work for everyone. But try it. Who knows what results you'll get!</p>
