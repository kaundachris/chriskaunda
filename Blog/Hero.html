        <p>Fair warning that first, this is going to be a relatively depressing article. Second is that it is going to
            be
            written from a mostly male perspective. If either of these are not your thing, feel free to skip this one.
            Why
            purposefully write a relatively depressing article? Because, counterintuitively, it offers some hope. But
            I’m
            weird
            that way. If you are too, read on.</p>

        <h4>Five Minutes</h4>

        <p>If you’ve been in a fight, you know what it feels like to get hit. Especially a headshot. Unless your
            adrenaline
            is
            really high, there’s probably nothing else that can knock you off center quite like getting a shot to the
            face.
            And
            Cerrone, in UFC 141, got hit in the face. He got hit in the face a lot. The punches weren’t necessarily
            heavy.
            But
            they were numerous in number. 40 headshots in the first round. 26 headshots in the second round. Every time
            he
            seemed to be close to getting a couple of hits on Diaz, Diaz would just unleash a barrage of hits in return.
            By
            the
            end of the second round, his face was covered in blood. He couldn’t see straight. He was exhausted in the
            way
            that
            only people who’ve been in a fight know. There’s resignation in his face. Going into the third and final
            round,
            as
            the doctors are patching him up as best as they can, his coach drops all decorum. ‘You give me five minutes
            of
            hell!
            You understand me son! <a
                href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxuszDQZL60go4UsTpxKqu2gHOqyWyjD4H?feature=shared" target="_blank">YOU
                GIVE ME FIVE
                MINUTES
                OF
                HELL!</a> His coach sees it for what it
            is. We see it too. We hope that he puts up a fight this time. And so Cerrone goes out. He gets hit for five
            more
            minutes. 35 headshots to be exact. And he loses the fight.</p>

        <h4>The Hero’s Journey</h4>

        <p>If there’s anything that to me sums up the entire experience of being a young man, it would be this fight.
            Every
            battle you enter into as a young man, is for the most part a losing battle. Whether it’s for jobs, for
            women,
            for
            recognition. There’s usually nobody more useless - and as such, expandable - to society like a young man. A
            lot
            of
            men have the experience of going through a period where they were functionally invisible. The same period
            where
            they
            wanted nothing more than to be seen. There is a fantasy that I think most men have, a fantasy that can only
            be
            summed up as ‘<a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/writing-101-what-is-the-heros-journey"
                target="_blank">The Hero’s
                Journey.</a>’
            It’s the fantasy of doing something that earns you the one currency that every man wants. The feeling of
            being
            needed. If a woman’s fantasy is to be wanted, a man’s is to be needed.</p>

        <p>The sad part is that when you look at life, especially as a young man, its usually the inverse of the hero's
            journey. We want to be Diaz in the fight. We want to win, and we want to win loudly. But for most of us,
            life
            often
            looks more like Cerrone’s side of the fight. Embarrassing defeat. We often have something (often someone) we
            wanted
            to go on that hero’s journey for. We want to be the savior. We want to be the one that she looks at
            longingly.
            But
            in our efforts to do so, we end up being the opposite. And it’s worse the harder we try. We fail, and we
            carry
            those
            failures with us. Failures that make us hurt. Failures that make us hate. Failures that turn some men cruel.
        </p>

        <h4>Innocence and Experience</h4>

        <p>There’s a thin line between innocence and experience. Innocence is often what you think the adventure will
            be.
            Experience is what the adventure actually is. Innocence is the man that thinks his life is going to look
            like
            the
            hero’s journey. But it most likely won’t be. We are embarrassing idiots way more than we are triumphant
            heroes.
            If
            you think otherwise, ask your girl, your mum, or your sisters, and watch them describe how embarrassing, but
            hopefully cute you are when you try. And even if you do succeed, experience will reveal to you that success
            usually
            isn’t celebratory. More often than not, it is a long sigh of relief. Relief is not fun. It is not exciting.
            Relief
            is actually, for the most part, a quiet experience. And a quiet experience is the antithesis of a hero’s
            journey.
            Because the hero is supposed to come back to a celebration. From his people. From his children. From his
            girl.
            And a
            lot of people will fuck up a good thing because they want the triumphant welcome. And they drift to where
            they
            get
            it. Whether that be bad situations. Bad people. Without realizing that nothing comes back from a black hole.
        </p>

        <h4>Who Are You</h4>

        <p>The thing about the hero’s journey, is that we think it centers on the external. At least we pick up on the
            external
            more than we do on the internal. But there’s a whole other aspect to the hero’s journey that we all seem to
            completely miss. And that is the internal journey. A good example of this is the Batman movies. I’m a big
            fan of
            the
            Batman universe and given how coveted making and starring in a Batman movie is, how much money the studios
            pour
            into
            the movies, and how there’s always another Batman movie around the corner, I can make a guess that I’m not
            the
            only
            fan. But when you watch all the batman movies, what you see is <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZdUDGzplKE" target="_blank">a man trying to get to terms with who
                he
                is</a>, and where he fits into the world. That’s all it is. It isn’t his
            money - that is usually in the background. It isn’t the women - they are usually just adjacent. It’s the
            internal
            turmoil of a man getting to grips with his fears. Getting the grip on who he is.</p>

        <p>Another good example comes from Avatar. The story in Avatar is as much Aang’s as it is Zuko’s. And in one of
            the
            most poignant scenes of the show, Uncle Iroh asks Zuko a question he seemingly hadn’t ever asked himself. A
            question
            Zuko was almost afraid of answering. A question that seems to cause unbearable cognitive dissonance in Zuko.
            But
            it’s a simple question really. A question that sets him on the path to the very greatness and validation he
            has
            longed for a long time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTZNvcP3Q28" target="_blank">‘Who are you?
                And what do you
                want?’</a></p>

        <p>Side note. Fam! Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, needs an Uncle Iroh. I’ve not seen any other character that
            has
            had
            such an impact on men - an indication being the sheer number of essays on that man on YouTube. If there is a
            character to set the standard for masculinity today, it would be the Dragon of the West.</p>

        <h4>Mind. Body. Time.</h4>

        <p>As you go on the hero’s journey, remember one thing. Wherever you run, and however far you run, there’s one
            person
            that’s going to be with you always. That person being you. As the saying in the addiction community goes, no
            matter
            how far you drive, you’re always the same distance away from the ditch. You are the person you should care
            the
            most
            about. The person you should watch out for the most. And when it comes to you as a person, there are three
            things
            that come to mind. Three things that you should ensure you maniacally protect. Your mind. Your body. And
            your
            time.</p>

        <p>I am about to tell you to do something I know you are not going to listen to. And that something is this:
            before
            you
            go on a hero’s journey for someone else, make sure you’ve done it for yourself. And what that is going to
            look
            like
            for a lot of you is again something I know you probably won’t follow. It is going to be you putting your
            head
            down,
            for a couple of years, and working your ass off. You are going to eat shit, yes. Whether it’s with jobs, or
            money,
            or women. But if you get through it, the shit goes away. Dr. Anna Lembke says that when it comes to
            addiction,
            all
            you’ve got to do is survive the first 21 days. Sounds easy, but those who’ve fought addiction know that
            those 21
            days will suck. They will be cold and dark. But on the 22nd day, <a
                href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxxGjZEXFmF-YI9S5Fk5fNyfP-BliClANo?feature=shared" target="_blank">the
                sun will
                rise</a>. The sun will shine, young
            padawan. So, cowboy, five minutes of hell, for the rest of your life.</p>
