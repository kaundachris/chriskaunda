        <p>There is a branch in the well. You’re alive because of this branch. It’s what you’re holding onto. It’s what
            is
            keeping you from falling into the darkness. But you know, sooner or later, it’s going to break. And you’re
            going
            to
            fall. You try not to disturb it too much lest it breaks unexpectedly. Everyday you look at it, checking for
            signs of
            weakness. Then one day, it sprouts. At first a bud. Then bud then becomes a leaf. Vibrant and green, in this
            desolate hole. Life to this seemingly dead branch you are holding on to. And it fills you with wonder. And
            it
            makes
            you happy. And you no longer want the branch to break. You’re presence can now only cause harm. And so you
            do
            what
            you think is best.</p>

        <h4>A Person</h4>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRIIwJh1DDQ" target="_blank">A person is smart. People are Dumb</a>.
            There’s benefit
            in
            camaraderie.
            That explains why someone is highly likely to agree with you (or at least not disagree with you) in a one on
            one
            conversation. There’s benefit in doing so. We are social creatures. And social interaction feels rewarding
            to us
            -
            you actually <a
                href="https://www.hprc-online.org/total-force-fitness/tff-strategies/social-fitness-and-performance-part-1-impact-brain-and-overall#:~:text=Social%20interaction%20falls%20into%20this,dopamine%2C%20serotonin%2C%20and%20endorphins"
                target="_blank">release
                dopamine,
                serotonin</a> and a whole other bunch of stuff from just interacting, and this includes with people you
            don’t know. Put two people
            of differing views in one room, and more likely than not, they will find a discourse.</p>

        <p>But it is precisely because of the benefit of camaraderie that a person will go back to the views of the
            social
            system they are part of. Because belonging to a social system beats being an outsider. It means having a
            home.
            Having a people. Different is not generally accepted in social systems. It is more looked at as a threat to
            the
            system. Any of you who have tried subverting a system knows how hard it is. You face resistance both
            internally
            and
            externally. You’re mind will constantly nudge you to agree. And the environment will do the same.</p>

        <h4>A Memory</h4>

        <p>Sometimes you feel stuck. Things are falling apart. And you crave the feeling of being unstuck. And you
            desire to
            put it all back together. In that moment, a memory will reach out. A memory from the past. A painful one. A
            delightful one. A nostalgic one. And it will spread its arms, welcoming you in. It’s okay to look at the
            past.
            Just.
            Don’t. Stare. Let go. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dCX4WfMZlM" target="_blank">But don’t close
                the door.</a> No
            matter how much
            it’s frowned upon, there is grace in letting go.</p>

        <h4>Causality</h4>

        <p>I have an unconventional belief that only about half of someone’s success is causal. The half that is causal
            is
            made
            up of two things predominantly. The first is the initial conditions. By that I mean where you were born and
            how
            you
            came up. Put simply, a person born rich is more likely to get rich because they already are. This person
            will
            get
            the best education. They’ll have powerful connections. It’s not to say that some of them don’t fail. It’s
            just
            to
            say that they have a much higher chance. The chances get slimmer if you are born only middle class. They get
            even
            slimmer when you are born poor. If you go down the list of billionaires, you’ll find that a lot of them had
            initial
            conditions that were out of the ordinary.</p>

        <p>The second would be the things like hard work, determination, and talent. These factors go a long way. Look
            at
            the
            wealthiest people and you find that a lot of them are working all the time. Just take a look at <a
                href="https://balancethegrind.co/daily-routines/elon-musk-daily-routine/#:~:text=Elon%20Musk%27s%20daily%20routine%20can,years%20is%20his%20sweet%20spot"
                target="_blank">Elon’s
                schedule</a>.
            And for a lot of them, it took an incredible amount of work to get their now gigantic companies off the
            ground.
            It
            meant working 16 hours a day. These people don’t just take a holiday. A holiday for them is to go to France
            to
            get a
            grant or tax benefit from the government - while also visiting the Eiffel Tower with their kids. There’s no
            wasted
            space.</p>

        <p>But out of eight billion people on the planet, I’m willing to bet that there’s at least one hundred million
            hard
            working people. And yet the vast majority of them are just surviving. Hard work, talent and determination
            don’t
            fully explain explain success for me. If they did, there’d be a million billionaires and a billion
            millionaires.
            There has to be another factor. For me, that factor is chance.</p>

        <h4>Men</h4>

        <p>Because we are men. And what we, men, want more than anything, is to taste greatness, no matter how fleeting.
            To
            know that we mattered.</p>

        <h4>Statistics</h4>

        <p>It was fascinating to watch people’s obsession with some rich people stuck in a submarine. That was the
            biggest
            news
            and social commentary topic for almost two weeks. As for that situation, I’ll just quote <a
                href="https://fourminutebooks.com/the-black-swan-summary/" target="_blank">Nassim
                Taleb</a>. One death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic. And
            statistics stay silent in us. Lives saved are a statistic, a person hurt an anecdote. Statistics are
            invisible.
            Anecdotes are salient.</p>

        <h4>Trust</h4>

        <p>What would happen if she cheated? To be honest, I don’t have an answer. There would be a lot of factors that
            determined what I’d do. But I can’t know now these factors now. And I can’t anticipate how I’d judge these
            factors -
            my views now will not be the same as my views then. But what I do know is that there are only a few things
            that
            hurt
            more than a betrayal of trust. There's a reason the lowest level of Dante's Inferno is reserved for people
            who
            betray. There's a reason God says betrayers are worse than murderers. Revelations 3:16, For you are
            lukewarm,
            neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out my mouth.</p>

        <h4>Nature</h4>

        <p>There are no straight lines in nature. If you ever see a straight line in your physical environment, it is
            man
            made.
            In fact, nature doesn’t have any of the shapes we use in our daily lives. Circles, ovals, triangles,
            rectangles,
            squares. None of these shapes exist in nature. at least never precisely. That’s because nature's shape is
            something
            that is not yet in our vocabulary. Nature is made up of self-similar patterns. Take a branch as a whole and
            it
            resembles the tree. Take the veins of a leaf and it resembles the branch and the tree. A child resembles the
            father
            and or mother. Humans resemble each other. So do fish. Nature is fractal.</p>

        <h4>Average</h4>

        <p>“He’s just an average joe.” This, in today’s world, equates to an insult. We don’t have the tolerance for
            average.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpX36VRAvKw" target="_blank">A psychiatrist I watch</a> observed
            that society is
            built
            to help the
            people on the extremes. It’s helps the people on one end of the spectrum - the bad one. The people in shitty
            situations. The poor. The marginalized. On the other end, its focuses on how to optimize the lives of those
            on
            the
            other end of the spectrum. People who are doing a lot, but want to do more. How do we optimize productivity.
            Time.
            Money. But everyone in the middle of that spectrum is left to fend for themselves. The vast majority of the
            people
            around average are stuck trying to do two things. Keep themselves out of the low end of the spectrum, and
            try as
            hard as possible to get into the higher end of the spectrum.
        </p>

        <p>Average people are always running. From something and towards something. All their life. Non-stop. And when
            someone
            settles for average, they are silently ostracized. They are not ambitious. They are lazy. ‘Why settle for
            less
            when
            there’s more?’ Someone in the circles of professional sports remarked at how that group of people live. A
            newbie
            in
            professional sports will make 700K a year. By any measure of wealth, he is rich. But in a field where he’s
            playing
            with someone making 25 million a year, he feels decidedly poor. The newbie might want to come to practice
            with a
            Prius, but the parking lot is filled with Ferraris and Bugattis. Let’s assume he’s okay with this. Well, his
            teammates will ostracize him, loudly and silently.</p>

        <p>We are social creatures. Hell for us is other people.</p>
