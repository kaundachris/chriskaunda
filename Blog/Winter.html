        <p>Its almost a year now since crypto peaked. Seems like its been forever, especially for an industry as noisy
            as
            crypto. Since November 2021, its been nothing but downtrends. We’ve had crypto bankruptcies -

            We’ve had collapsing stable coins such as <a

                Luna</a>.
            The Merge got delayed a couple of times - not surprising. And the liquidations that have occurred have done
            nothing to help the market. At least some of the leverage is out of the system. If you are/were a long term
            crypto investor during this period, it has been nothing but pain. But thing is, this is all part of the
            cycle
            for crypto. If you take a look back at the trajectory of cryptocurrencies, there seems to be a pattern of
            boom
            and busts, commonly known as the bull an bear cycles.
        </p>

        <h4>The Bull Cycle</h4>

        <p>The way to think about these cycles is in terms of enthusiasm. This is when everyone gets into the new thing,
            in
            droves, driving the price high. Think of when some new shoes are out, or when the new iPhone has just
            launched.
            That’s what the bull cycle usually is. Applying basic economics, the more demand there is for something, the
            more people are willing to pay for it.</p>

        <p>The classic example for us Kenyans involves matatus. I hail from Ngong, and if my route is the same as yours,
            we
            have manyangas that come out, all hype, from time to time. Commuting using these manyangas is usually the
            cool
            thing - at least for some, like me. But for this coolness, there’s usually a premium to the fare. Yes,
            there’s
            the comfortable seats, the rare stop by the police, the music. But you can get these luxuries elsewhere. The
            premium you’re paying is to be part of the cool club. And the more of you there are, the more premium the
            touts
            will charge. But as with every manyanga, there’s usually a shelf life before its out of style. The old
            thing.</p>

        <p>This is the same for crypto. The <a
                href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi72qXOhr75AhUSTBoKHaVABgUQFnoECAsQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Fwhat-is-a-bull-market%23%3A~%3Atext%3DA%2520bull%2520market%2520is%2520an%2Cand%2520a%2520strong%2520overall%2520economy.&usg=AOvVaw1aUHB5ElFUGuVcX_Anli1B">bull
                cycle</a>
            is when there is a lot of enthusiasm for crypto products, sometimes with no respect to the underlying
            fundamentals. This is mostly during the periods when people are making money. Among the few who do, some
            broadcast it. Those on the outside see this and want in, buying into the hype. They’ll be willing to pay the
            premium to get in, and the cycle continues until we have some absolutely insane prices.</p>

        <h4>The Bear Cycle</h4>

        <p>While there are some reasonable investments done by smart people during bull cycles, a lot of investing is
            done
            based on the assumption that prices will keep going up. A lot of people are driven by FOMO, and greed. But
            the
            market is usually self correcting. Usually. Whenever prices get too far ahead of the fundamentals, they
            usually
            fall, and fall hard. This can be seen in the current cycle we’re in. Bitcoin, as an example, fell from ~USD
            60K
            to as low as USD 18K. As I’m currently writing this, its at around ~USD 23K. This is because the market was
            suffering from high levels of speculation, with a large percentage of buyers not fully aware of what they
            are
            buying.</p>

        <p>During lockdown, there was a lot of <a
                href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/money-printing-and-inflation%3A-covid-cryptocurrencies-and-more">money
                printing</a> going
            on due to Central Bank policies, which created a surplus of money in the hands of the consumer. Top this up
            with
            the fact that the consumer was spending a lot of time at home, and the crypto craze built up. Since most
            people
            aren’t aware what they are buying, then the basis is usually centered on prices. There is little to no
            conviction on the asset. And this creates a highly erratic investor. The money printing started driving
            prices
            of household products up. These same people started cutting back. Some stated offloading their crypto,
            taking
            the profits. Eventually, the supply outstrips the demand. This - applying basic economics - causes prices to
            drop. When the prices don’t behave as projected, those fickle investors will only do one thing. Sell. This
            creates downward pressure on prices, which causes more people to try and cash in on their profits. And the
            cycle
            continues.</p>

        <h4>Take Advantage?</h4>

        <p>Due to the underperformance of crypto in bear markets, people tend to lose interest and pull out. Maybe
            there’s
            a new fad somewhere else where people can run to. This creates a period of time known as crypto winter,
            where
            prices remain depressed for a period of time. This creates a unique opportunity if you have high conviction
            on
            the future of crypto. It creates a situation where everything is selling at a bargain price! You look left,
            60%
            off. Look right, 80% off. Everything is at least half price. That means you can get more crypto for each
            unit
            investment than you would have before. You have USD 20K? Well then now you can get 0.86 Bitcoin as compared
            to
            November, where you’d only get 0.33 Bitcoin. You can build up a bigger position a lot faster and a lot
            cheaper
            in a bear market than in a bull market.</p>

        <p>Bear markets also allow you more time to do your research. Prices are low, and the amount of noise is low.
            You’re not trying to race a bunch of straight up gamblers, fearing that they’ll price you out before you
            make a
            decision. You have the time to really consider a project and its advantages, and the price you’re willing to
            pay
            for it. That, in any market, is a godsend, and will save you a lot of cash and pain. I’m personally using
            this
            time to understand <a href="https://www.oswego.edu/cts/basics-about-cryptocurrency">how cryptocurrencies
                work</a>, what
            stable coins are, and all the interesting things that can be done on the blockchain. Heck, I’m even now
            reading
            the fine print for the exchanges I use to fully understand the exposure I have - there’s some pretty
            interesting
            things in there.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

        <p>People who bought crypto during the previous bear cycle, are still over 400% up. People who bought in the
            bull
            cycle during Covid, are anywhere between 30% and 60% down. If you’re in or wanting to get into crypto,
            there’s
            probably not a better time. A lot of people will say to wait it out. But my guess is that its basic human
            psychology, with the fear of losses reigning over anything else. But the losses you can experience now -when
            everything’s bad and gloomy, and prices are low - are a lot less than the losses you’ll experience if you
            enter
            at a time when prices are going up. And the upside is a lot bigger. This way, you get to buy at low prices,
            and
            enjoy the ride when the prices go up high, if the prices go up. There’s always the possibility they might
            not.
            Until next time!</p>
