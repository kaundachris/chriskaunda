            <p>Its almost a year now since crypto peaked. Seems like its been forever, especially for an industry as
                noisy
                as
                crypto. Since November 2021, its been nothing but downtrends. We’ve had crypto bankruptcies -

                The Merge got delayed a couple of times - not surprising. And the liquidations that have occurred have
                done
                nothing to help the market. At least some of the leverage is out of the system. If you are/were a long
                term
                crypto investor during this period, it has been nothing but pain. But thing is, this is all part of the
                cycle
                for crypto. If you take a look back at the trajectory of cryptocurrencies, there seems to be a pattern
                of
                boom
                and busts, commonly known as the bull an bear cycles.
            </p>

            <h4>The Bull Cycle</h4>

            <p>The way to think about these cycles is in terms of enthusiasm. This is when everyone gets into the new
                thing,
                in
                droves, driving the price high. Think of when some new shoes are out, or when the new iPhone has just
                launched.
                That’s what the bull cycle usually is. Applying basic economics, the more demand there is for something,
                the
                more people are willing to pay for it.</p>

            <p>The classic example for us Kenyans involves matatus. I hail from Ngong, and if my route is the same as
                yours,
                we
                have manyangas that come out, all hype, from time to time. Commuting using these manyangas is usually
                the
                cool
                thing - at least for some, like me. But for this coolness, there’s usually a premium to the fare. Yes,
                there’s
                the comfortable seats, the rare stop by the police, the music. But you can get these luxuries elsewhere.
                The
                premium you’re paying is to be part of the cool club. And the more of you there are, the more premium
                the
                touts
                will charge. But as with every manyanga, there’s usually a shelf life before its out of style. The old
                thing.</p>

            <p>This is the same for crypto. The <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi72qXOhr75AhUSTBoKHaVABgUQFnoECAsQAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Fpersonal-finance%2Fwhat-is-a-bull-market%23%3A~%3Atext%3DA%2520bull%2520market%2520is%2520an%2Cand%2520a%2520strong%2520overall%2520economy.&usg=AOvVaw1aUHB5ElFUGuVcX_Anli1B"
                    target="_blank">bull
                    cycle</a>
                is when there is a lot of enthusiasm for crypto products, sometimes with no respect to the underlying
                fundamentals. This is mostly during the periods when people are making money. Among the few who do, some
                broadcast it. Those on the outside see this and want in, buying into the hype. They’ll be willing to pay
                the
                premium to get in, and the cycle continues until we have some absolutely insane prices.</p>

            <h4>The Bear Cycle</h4>

            <p>While there are some reasonable investments done by smart people during bull cycles, a lot of investing
                is
                done
                based on the assumption that prices will keep going up. A lot of people are driven by FOMO, and greed.
                But
                the
                market is usually self correcting. Usually. Whenever prices get too far ahead of the fundamentals, they
                usually
                fall, and fall hard. This can be seen in the current cycle we’re in. Bitcoin, as an example, fell from
                ~USD
                60K
                to as low as USD 18K. As I’m currently writing this, its at around ~USD 23K. This is because the market
                was
                suffering from high levels of speculation, with a large percentage of buyers not fully aware of what
                they
                are
                buying.</p>

            <p>During lockdown, there was a lot of <a
                    href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/money-printing-and-inflation%3A-covid-cryptocurrencies-and-more"
                    target="_blank">money
                    printing</a> going
                on due to Central Bank policies, which created a surplus of money in the hands of the consumer. Top this
                up
                with
                the fact that the consumer was spending a lot of time at home, and the crypto craze built up. Since most
                people
                aren’t aware what they are buying, then the basis is usually centered on prices. There is little to no
                conviction on the asset. And this creates a highly erratic investor. The money printing started driving
                prices
                of household products up. These same people started cutting back. Some stated offloading their crypto,
                taking
                the profits. Eventually, the supply outstrips the demand. This - applying basic economics - causes
                prices to
                drop. When the prices don’t behave as projected, those fickle investors will only do one thing. Sell.
                This
                creates downward pressure on prices, which causes more people to try and cash in on their profits. And
                the
                cycle
                continues.</p>

            <h4>Take Advantage?</h4>

            <p>Due to the underperformance of crypto in bear markets, people tend to lose interest and pull out. Maybe
                there’s
                a new fad somewhere else where people can run to. This creates a period of time known as crypto winter,
                where
                prices remain depressed for a period of time. This creates a unique opportunity if you have high
                conviction
                on
                the future of crypto. It creates a situation where everything is selling at a bargain price! You look
                left,
                60%
                off. Look right, 80% off. Everything is at least half price. That means you can get more crypto for each
                unit
                investment than you would have before. You have USD 20K? Well then now you can get 0.86 Bitcoin as
                compared
                to
                November, where you’d only get 0.33 Bitcoin. You can build up a bigger position a lot faster and a lot
                cheaper
                in a bear market than in a bull market.</p>

            <p>Bear markets also allow you more time to do your research. Prices are low, and the amount of noise is
                low.
                You’re not trying to race a bunch of straight up gamblers, fearing that they’ll price you out before you
                make a
                decision. You have the time to really consider a project and its advantages, and the price you’re
                willing to
                pay
                for it. That, in any market, is a godsend, and will save you a lot of cash and pain. I’m personally
                using
                this
                time to understand <a href="https://www.oswego.edu/cts/basics-about-cryptocurrency" target="_blank">how
                    cryptocurrencies
                    work</a>, what
                stable coins are, and all the interesting things that can be done on the blockchain. Heck, I’m even now
                reading
                the fine print for the exchanges I use to fully understand the exposure I have - there’s some pretty
                interesting
                things in there.</p>

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>

            <p>People who bought crypto during the previous bear cycle, are still over 400% up. People who bought in the
                bull
                cycle during Covid, are anywhere between 30% and 60% down. If you’re in or wanting to get into crypto,
                there’s
                probably not a better time. A lot of people will say to wait it out. But my guess is that its basic
                human
                psychology, with the fear of losses reigning over anything else. But the losses you can experience now
                -when
                everything’s bad and gloomy, and prices are low - are a lot less than the losses you’ll experience if
                you
                enter
                at a time when prices are going up. And the upside is a lot bigger. This way, you get to buy at low
                prices,
                and
                enjoy the ride when the prices go up high, if the prices go up. There’s always the possibility they
                might
                not.
                Until next time!</p>
