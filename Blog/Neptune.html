        <p>‘You are not the man you think yourself to be.’ That’s what she told me. I did not see that coming. And
            that
            knocked me off my feet. A lot. My ego had been attacked. And the knee jerk reaction is to try and defend
            yourself. But for some reason, I held back. I knew trying to defending myself would be futile. Not in
            this
            specific scenario. I had a million questions, and I was trying to sift through them so that I could ask
            the
            best ones. But I was also judging which questions were actually going to be answered directly, or in a
            constructive manner. And I figured that a lot of them probably weren’t going to be answered, or we going
            to
            cause a lot more animosity. But that discussion left me in a state of shock for a couple of days. It
            stayed
            on my mind for a full 24 hours. I couldn’t figure out why. That is until I deduced that the issue was.
            This
            conversation had left me in existential dread. It had made me feel helpless. There was a train coming.
            There
            was no stopping it.</p>

        <h4>You Can’t Understand</h4>

        <p>One of the things I was told repeatedly is that I can’t understand. I imply can’t. I am not a woman. How
            could I possibly ever get a grasp of what a woman goes through? Me, a man. Who has all the privileges
            that
            the patriarchy has bestowed on him. Me, a man, who’s life struggles can never, ever compare to the
            struggles
            the woman has to go through. Me, a man, who doesn’t know what sexual assault is. Me, a man, who doesn’t
            know
            the feeling of being scared. Me, an man, who by virtue of being a man, is the fucking problem. That’s
            the
            message I got. And while there is truth to this message, think about what it signals to a man who wants
            to
            understand. A man who actually wants to help. It signals that he is of no use in the struggle. That he
            doesn’t have a part to play. The woes of the other sex are caused solely by his sex. Solely. There is no
            other cause. It’s me. And besides, how can someone help a situation they are told they can never get?
        </p>

        <p>But spoiler alert, there are men who want to help. But they don’t know what to do. They don’t know where
            to
            start. And so they choose to steer clear. But that only serves to reinforce whatever prejudices are
            there.
            That men are self centered. Only care about themselves. That our walking away is because we don't
            support
            women's issues. That were being assholes, just as we always have been, just as we always will be.</p>

        <p>There exists people that want to help. Many of them. They just get drowned out when blanket statements
            like
            ‘all men are trash’ are made. They get drowned out when they are all lumped into the fucking patriarchy.
            Generalizations and stereotypes are hard to outrun. You have to always be perfect. Always. One foot
            wrong,
            and you get lumped back to the stereotype. ‘That’s what these men are like. You have to get used to
            them.’</p>

        <h4>If You Would Just Listen</h4>

        <p>‘If you were a good man, you would just listen.’ This is one of the answers I got when I asked what
            exactly
            a ‘good man’ was. And this is another thing that messed with my mental a bit. Because all through the
            conversation, I was listening. I was. For me, there’s one simple signifier that someone is listening.
            They
            ask questions. They ask for clarifications. They engage in the conversation outside of nodding their
            heads.
            Because everybody can nod their heads. Few can ask questions. But it seemed to me that asking questions,
            trying to understand, was a signifier that I don’t understand, that I can’t understand. Pushing back on
            some
            things being said was me being misogynistic. Pushing back on logical fallacies and blanket statements
            was a
            signal that I wasn’t even trying to be empathetic. It was me having an opinion on women’s issues. And
            men,
            it seems, are not allowed an opinion when it comes to this. This is a freedom they are not entitled to.
            You're not supposed to offer any rebuttal that might help to make sure that the argument being put
            forward
            is robust. No. If I was trying to help, all I had to do was shut up and listen. Shut up and listen.</p>

        <p>I’ve always thought of myself as a good listener. But this conversation made me realize that I’d been
            doing
            it wrong the whole time. What I’d been doing so far, is letting someone talk. But letting someone talk
            doesn’t exactly mean that you’re listening, does it?</p>

        <h4>To Always Strive To Be Of Service</h4>

        <p>This is the motto I’ve lived by over the past year or so. To always strive to be of service. But this
            conversation left me feeling helpless. For one, it felt like walking on eggshells. Especially as the
            said
            perpetrator. I had to measure my words. Say the right thing. Do the right thing. Else it would be
            attributed
            to my imperfections as a man. It made me realize that everything I do is a factor of my seeming
            privilege of
            being a man. It’s one of the things that I was told during the conversation. That I needed to accept my
            privilege. On the other hand, being a man, by default, is to be a part of the problem. This must be how
            white people today feel. I had to question my assumptions and judgements. Every time I asked myself what
            I
            could do to help the situation, I got a seemingly simple answer back. Whenever someone is angry at
            something
            in general that has no face, it’s because they are angry at something specific that does have a face.
            And
            while the answer was pretty obvious to me, it was not taken very kindly. Plus this is a solution that
            starts
            with the individual. And solutions that start with the individual are always a pain.</p>

        <h4>The Tyranny of the Majority</h4>

        <p>The assumption when you get a person out of tyranny is that anything’s better than tyranny. And so Moses
            led
            his people out of captivity, and towards the promised land. And that was supposed to be quick and easy.
            And
            it was supposed to be better than what they had left behind. But the Israelites ended up spending 40
            years
            in the desert. A journey that should have taken a month at most. The Egyptians tried to go after them.
            To
            bring them back. But they drowned in the process. A futile attempt. Eventually they let go. And during
            those
            forty years, a lot happened with the Israelites. It was a period characterized by conflict. There was a
            lot
            of confusion. they were bitten by snakes. A lot of snakes. A lot of the Israelites lost faith. They lost
            faith in the promise. They lost faith in their god. They turned to idols. They did eventually get there
            though, but after a lot of chaos.</p>

        <p>We are in the middle of a cultural revolution. The rules are being re-written. And there will be a lot of
            chaos before we settle down into a steady state. There will be conflict. There will be confusion. We are
            fumbling in the dark, trying to figure out how to make this work. Some want to go back to the old order,
            but
            I don’t think that’s happening. We are going to keep stumbling forward, until we reach some solid
            ground.
            This is a journey in which I’m not exactly sure how I can be of service to the general. But I can be of
            service to the particular - those around me that do actually want my help, and are willing to walk me
            through how to be of help. Maybe that’s the only way.</p>
