            <p>Last year was been a hell of a ride. Its been the year when everything I did seemed to be mistimed.
                Misplaced.
                This goes for the topic of this blog - investing - but also in personal life. Its been the year when
                I’ve
                tried
                a lot of things. Experimented with stuff. But its also been the year when I’ve experienced a lot of
                failures.
                But I think failure is a factor of trying stuff out. You don’t fail as much if you don’t try stuff out.
                Its
                the
                famous ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6sbPCIEMyI" target="_blank">fuck around and find out
                    matrix</a>.’ So this
                article is
                going to be a lot of personal mixed with finance. You can spare yourself the trouble by just clicking
                out at
                this point. If you do continue, I promise this isn’t a flex. And I’m not asking for help. I’m just
                unloading
                to
                you, a random stranger who could give two fucks.</p>

            <h4>Anxiety Attacks</h4>

            <p>I started having <a
                    href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/mental-wellbeing/anxiety-and-panic/how-to-deal-with-panic-attacks"
                    target="_blank">anxiety
                    attacks</a>
                sometime in May, maybe June. This was a first for me, and it was completely foreign. For me, it
                manifests
                like a
                sinking feeling in my chest. Breathing becomes fast, you heartbeat goes up drastically, your vision
                blurs,
                and
                you start feeling woozy. I’m aware of what the trigger was, but I can’t really discuss it at the moment.
                But
                it
                was a mixture of a host of things. I don’t know about you, but this thing called life is fucking scary
                to
                me.
                The wild plans you have, the immense - but probably imagined - pressure to succeed in life, whatever
                that
                means.
                It was getting to me. And this coming from a guy who doesn’t even have social media. I can only imagine
                how
                bad
                it would be if I was constantly scrolling looking at people’s ‘perfect’ lives. The attacks disappeared
                after
                a
                while, and I was super proud of myself for having dealt with my problems by myself. You know, like a man
                should
                - again, whatever that means. But they simply turned into something else, lethargy. Or to be more
                precise,
                mild
                depression.</p>

            <h4>Depression</h4>

            <p>Its been the year that I experienced depression for the first time in a while. Last time I got depressed
                was
                back in 2018, and that involved a whole lot of drinking and wilding out. I look back at the time with
                both
                nostalgia and cringe - lots of cringe. And I almost went back there this year. I started drinking a lot
                more
                than I have in the last two years. And towards the later part of the year, I was overcome by
                <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/fatigue" target="_blank">lethargy</a>. I couldn’t
                keep
                up with my
                schedule anymore. I
                assumed it was because I was taking up too much. Trying to do a lot at once. But that wasn’t it. Maybe
                it
                was
                due to the fact that I was getting older and slower? Maybe. But even stuff that I enjoyed became a chore
                to
                do.
                And thing is, I wasn’t fully aware of the state until late December, when I was talking to my mum and
                she
                mentioned that she noticed it too. I’m supposed to be self aware. At least I think I am. And I hate that
                it
                took
                me until the end of the year to figure out that that was was was going on with me. I could have tried
                fixing
                it
                a lot sooner. But not everything goes how we want it to go, does it.
            </p>

            <h4>Financial Pain</h4>

            <p>I closed the year down around 15% on my investments. As an absolute figure, that is a lot of money to
                lose. I
                made a couple of stupid decisions, such as buying highly risky assets without doing my due diligence. I
                lost
                a
                lot of money figuring out how to get into the stock market, and how to play it. I realized how banks
                make
                their
                insane profits - converting to currencies like USD, especially using local banks, is fucking expensive.
                The
                margins these guys have between buying and selling prices is almost criminal. I bought into
                cryptocurrencies,
                and what a fucking year it has been for cryptocurrencies. While I still have faith in crypto, 2022 has
                done
                a
                very good job at shaking that fear. I bought a lot of stocks that have just been painful to hold. I have
                to
                keep
                reminding myself of the <a
                    href="https://weitzinvestments.com/about/content/high-conviction-portfolio.fs"
                    target="_blank">convictions</a> I
                developed for them - convictions developed after the fact, instead of before. At first I thought myself
                invincible. The everyday movements didn’t bother me. But I think they did. The stock market, especially
                for
                long
                term investors, is not for the faint hearted. I went from enthusiasm, to obsession, to panic, to
                despair,
                and
                finally, I think, to acceptance.</p>

            <p>I’ve only been in the green for about a month in total so far. And the movements mean your paper value -
                for
                those of us who keep track at least - can be good in one month, and extremely depressing in another.
                Imagine
                doing the math on your finances and realizing in a period of a month, even without spending much, you
                are
                worth
                significantly less. And you didn’t even party or enjoy yourself. If there’s one year where having cash
                was
                good,
                it was 2022. The only saving grace is that the USD has appreciated by like <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/search?q=usd+to+ksh&oq=usd&aqs=edge.0.69i59j69i57j0i512j0i131i433i512l5j69i60.1241j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"
                    target="_blank">9%
                    since I started investing back in
                    January</a>.
                That means that, since I record my finances in KES, I’ve gained, almost passively, around the same
                amount in
                my
                local currency. At least on paper. But the percentage number in the brokerage account is what matters,
                and
                it is
                in red double digits. Not a pretty sight to see.</p>

            <p>The question I’ve been asking myself the past few months is whether I should just pull out - no pun
                intended.
                Sell it all, and buy the shit I want. Enjoy myself, take trips. All that stuff people my age are
                actually
                doing.
                But I think not. If push comes to shove, I’ll simply pause investing and keep whatever’s already there,
                there. I
                don’t really need the money to do all the stuff I just mentioned above. I can manage with what I have
                outside of
                it, and what will come in the future. So that amount stays in. I might recycle it into other more
                promising
                - or
                to be honest - safer stocks. But it stays there. That’s a commitment I made. I’m sticking to it. Its the
                price
                of education - at least that’s what I tell myself. Its about making less costly mistakes over time. At
                this
                age,
                I can make a mistake, even a costly one, and recover. There’s plenty of time for me - again, that’s what
                I
                tell
                myself.</p>

            <h4>But something’s working..</h4>

            <p>With all that said, 2022 has also been a pleasantly surprising year. There’s a clarity that I’ve had in
                the
                year
                that I didn’t have before. A conviction. Maybe it comes from daring yourself to do things you wouldn’t
                normally
                do. But its been a year where I’ve had some of the most exciting interactions with people. A year when
                I’ve
                connected with people I would never have thought I’d connect to. A year where something just clicks. You
                don’t
                even notice it yourself. Its others who do. Maybe its delusion. Maybe I’m just full of myself. There’s
                some
                freedom you get by just doing what you want to do, how you want to do it. And I’ve cultivated that for
                myself in
                this blog, along with a few other places in my life. And I think I’ll make sure to retain these aspects
                of
                my
                life going forward. I think everyone should. <a
