    <h1 class="centre">Banks</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p><em class="intro">So my account recently got blocked by my bank. Why? Crypto.</em></p>

        <p>I have been interested in crypto for a while now. Aside from watching Bitcoin go up like 1000%, I have been
            wondering whether this was the next frontier in the finance space. We’ve had a couple of lifechanging
            developments that we seem to take for granted, and more importantly, seem to understand very little about.
            First
            we had barter, with its many inconveniences such as determining value. We then had paper money, which became
            the
            proxy for value, while being valueless in itself. We then had debt, where we discovered that we can enjoy
            thing
            we want with money we don’t have. And finally, and most recently, virtual money, when we discovered that
            money
            can be completely intangible. Ones and zeros on a screen.</p>

        <h4>Background</h4>

        <p>With this curiosity in mind, I have been <a
                href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/basics/dollar-cost-averaging/">dollar cost
                averaging</a> into the crypto market for
            close to six months now. It was probably the worst time to enter the market, with the whole crypto crash and
            all. It is likely a stupid decision on my part, but I keep crypto at around 10% of my entire portfolio. I
            got in
            when crypto was around 40K, and watched my initial investment halve in a matter of weeks. Yikes. But I’ve
            kept
            on buying every month, as the DCA approach seems to be the one that consistently give the best results. This
            finding is of course related to stock market investing, but with crypto and the stock market so highly
            correlated these days, what’s the difference? Besides, I’m only 25% down on my crypto portfolio. That isn’t
            so
            bad, right? Right?</p>

        <h4>Not Your Money</h4>

        <p>The strategy worked well for a while. That is until a few weeks back when the recurring buy I set up with my
            exchange executed. The transactions went through, but a day later I realized that I couldn’t withdraw money
            from
            my account. That was followed by a call from one of the bank’s representatives, who asked a couple of
            questions,
            then told me to call customer care to have the issue sorted out. “Won’t take that long. Just call them.
            They’ll
            sort it out,” she said. However, the representatives weren’t seeing anything wrong with my account. That or
            they
            did, but didn’t know how to handle it. So they’d just take me in circles, until one asked me to visit a
            branch.
            A side note: customer care really is a weird job sometimes. Product teams and management make decisions
            without
            any sort of consultation, and customer care is left to deal with the backlash. Seems kind of unfair, but
            that’s
            the world we live in.</p>

        <h4>Give It Back!</h4>

        <p>What was interesting to me was that there were no procedures in place for this situation. The agent I was
            speaking to was at a loss, completely unsure how to handle the situation. After a few call, he determined
            the
            cause. Apparently my account had been flagged by the compliance department. There were some new directives
            by
            the Central Bank to stop transactions in crypto through the banks. But here’s the funny thing, even the
            compliance department didn’t have a process to get my account back up! They determined that I had to
            handwrite
            an acknowledgement letter, addressed to the manager of the branch that I was at, that I was not going to
            continue buying crypto using my account. HAND-WRITE. In 2022. And what happens after that? They gave the
            manager
            the letter, and she’s like, ‘what’s this?’ And a whole discussion ensues on whether the letter would be
            sufficient. Goes to show that they’re making this shit up as they go.</p>

        <h4>Why Though!</h4>

        <p>Maybe I should stop. It is a pretty risky asset class. If it is an asset class at all. But its too big now to
            simply go away. Its too entrenched into a part of the population to be forgotten. I don’t have any good
            reasons
            why it will become the next big thing. All I do know is that there’s a chance it might. Most central banks
            are
            thinking of developing and issuing their own digital currencies. That might be a sign that crypto’s here to
            stay. They’re just making it hard for the ones they don’t control, as they build ones that they do. The
            issues
            raised about money laundering and corruption are valid, but I don’t think they are the full story. And while
            one
            might argue that the central banks have no right to control how I use my own money, you have to remember,
            its
            not your money. Its theirs. They’ve just lent it out to you, under very specific conditions.</p>

        <h4>Oh Well!</h4>

        <p>Long story short, I did manage to get my account operating again. Only I can’t buy any crypto. However, basic
            human psychology will tell you that this kind of policing makes you want to do the very thing that’s being
            policed a lot more than before. Its just a question of how. There are many ways to skin a cat.</p>

        <p>For those curious, I use <a href="https://coinbase.com/join/lbubsd">Coinbase</a> to purchase crypto. I only
            have four
            cryptocurrencies in my portfolio. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and Cardano. With “<a
                href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-the-merge-and-why-has-it-taken-so-long/">the
                merge</a>” coming up for Ethereum,
            and the corresponding price appreciation, Eth makes up close to 35% of my crypto portfolio - the largest
            holding. But Bitcoin’s close behind. And yes, I’ve staked whatever can be staked, and earn around 4% APY. I
            will
            say that crypto’s highly volatile, and can lose you a lot of money, if not all of it. So this isn’t
            financial
            advice, and you do have to do your own research. A lot of it, if you’re smart. I can’t stay out of it
            completely, so I only put in a small amount every month - the amount most people spend on junk food or
            alcohol
            every month. If it turn into something, good! If it doesn’t, I’ve learnt. And better to learn earlier than
            later.</p>
