        <p>I love misfits. People who go to rooms where they don’t belong. People who do things that are ‘not the norm.’
            I
            don’t mean those who do this for the sake of doing it, For the sake of being different. I mean those who
            just
            are. They can exist within a system without necessarily conforming to it. We know these people. Its the
            people
            who are in, but also out at the same time. And I think that they are the ones who truly change the world.
            Who
            create a big enough paradigm shift, that the world is never the same again. They shift the axis, for better
            or
            for worse. And its these misfits that I look up to. I spent the last article trying to show how most of
            these
            successful people shouldn’t be taken seriously. And while I still stand by this, I have to admit that I also
            have people who I look to. <a

                upon whose shoulders I stand
                on</a>,
            so that I can see a lot further than I would otherwise. The difference for me - I think - is that I pay
            little
            attention to what they say, and a lot more attention to what they do. Because its the ‘doing’ part that has
            got
            them to where they are.</p>

        <h4>Virgil Abloh</h4>

        <p>He died way too young. He was at the height of his career. The creative director of LVMH. And what a journey
            he
            had. He was part of the group of misfits spearheaded by Kanye West. He was part of the group that went to
            the
            <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fashion-runway-kanye-went-paris-fashion-week-ready-to-wear-2017">Paris
                Fashion Week in
                2009</a>. A bunch of
            black dudes in goofy clothes. A bunch of people who didn’t fit the mold for the high fashion clientele. They
            didn’t talk right. They didn’t have the wealth. They didn’t walk right. And most of all, they didn’t look
            right.
            But they didn’t care. And because that establishment refused them, they went on to start things of their
            own.
            Virgil created Pyrex (only street fashion guys recognize the name), which eventually fed to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-White_(company)">Off-White</a>.
        </p>

        <p>When the system wouldn’t allow him to join their club - for reasons overt and covert - he went and created
            his
            own. He didn’t ask for permission. He just did it. Because that’s what he wanted to do. He did the weird
            thing
            until it wasn’t weird anymore. Until it was mainstream. Until his own creation that eventually got him into
            the
            club he always wanted to be part of. Him being appointed the creative director of LVMH was big news only to
            specific circles. But for those circles, it was bigger than anything else bar Obama’s presidency. It was a
            win
            for everyone. Kanye always wanted that position, but he was just as proud when his brother got it. Salty.
            But
            proud. And while he died young, he died a legend.</p>

        <h4>Kanye West</h4>

        <p>Kanye has for the most part, fallen from grace with most people. His recent comments and antics have left a
            sour
            taste even for people who loved him. And that includes me. But one thing that I love about Kanye, is his
            ability
            to <a href="https://youtu.be/RvaakT52RjQ">just speak his mind</a>. We live in a world where we have to
            filter
            everything we
            say so that we don’t offend some Karen somewhere. So that we don’t get cancelled. And most celebrities -
            because
            they don’t want to lose what they have - tow the line. They say what they are supposed to say, and do what
            they
            are supposed to do. And those celebrities who got fame by being different - which is most - become part of
            the
            crowd. Most of them never put out stuff that is truly great again. And a few who realize what they’ve become
            a
            part of, and take to extreme measure like alcohol, drugs, and taking their own lives. I think the reason
            Kanye
            has been able to cope is because he has never been anything other than himself.</p>

        <p>The kid worked his ass off to become a producer. The kid gave it his all to become a rapper. And once he had
            achieved this, he set his sights on becoming a fashion icon. This faithfulness to who he is is reflected in
            his
            work. From <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4Uv86qWpGTxf7fU7lG5X6F?si=vyRUJyOXSLaPwHVj5k-TsA">College
                Dropout</a>,
            to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7gsWAHLeT0w7es6FofOXk1?si=oew62Dw7TmmippCapduU7w">The Life of
                Pablo</a>, to
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5CnpZV3q5BcESefcB3WJmz?si=aMPvRwbAQFSE1Pr-MUvwrQ">Donda</a>, his
            work speaks
            for
            itself. Kanye doesn’t need to be in the top five rappers of all time list. He isn’t. But if there was a list
            of
            the greatest all round artist, He’d be up there. If there was a list of icons, he’d be up there. Most
            celebrities, once they get to a point where everyone recognizes their name, fade away into the background,
            only
            appearing at opportune moments. But Kanye hasn’t let his status take away from his weird independent
            thoughts.
            And I wouldn’t be surprised if he finds a way to reinvent himself. Because that’s the kind of otherworldly
            force
            you get when you have a mom like <a
                href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0WSEq9Ko4kFPt8yo3ICd6T?si=1a306cc933cf4038">Donda
                West</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Frank Ocean</h4>

        <p>Whenever someone asks me who my favorite artist is, my immediate answer is usually Frank Ocean. No other
            artist’s music has made me feel as much as Frank’s music has. No other artist have I had as much patience
            for as
            Frank - given his long absences. That’s because his work is timeless. Whichever album it is, I can always go
            back and listen to it. And the feeling is still the same. That and the fact that his absences usually mean
            something truly beautiful is on the way. Its like when J. Cole and Kendrick get shaggy. You know something’s
            cooking.</p>

        <p>Frank was part of another group of misfits called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Future">Odd
                Future</a>. A
            group that counts Tyler, the Creator and Syd as some of its members. But if there was a group that truly
            embodied the meaning of the word ‘misfits,’ it was Odd Future. And Frank, for the truly phenomenal artist
            that
            he is, is truly odd. This is the guy that sampled other people’s beats to create his first mixtape.
            Nostalgia,
            Ultra. A thing that got him into a lot of trouble with the musical greats, among them being the Eagles
            (think
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/40riOy7x9W7GXjyGp4pjAv?si=48b41457fb644b2b">Hotel California</a>).
            This is the
            same
            guy whose songwriting is so weird that you never really know what he means. The guy who’s first album,
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/392p3shh2jkxUxY2VHvlH8?si=TffhqcwbTLaNK3MbuOS8IQ">Channel
                Orange</a>, while weird,
            idiosyncratic and unconventional, won the Album of the Year. This is the same guy that was named one of the
            world’s most influential people. And yet, outside of just a few circles, no one knew his name. This is the
            guy
            that has written songs for Beyonce. The guy that has appeared in Jay Z and Kanye’s albums. This is the guy
            that
            Jay Z told to act his net worth (Frank lived out of his suitcase of a few clothes, jumping from hotel room
            to
            hotel room. And not even fancy hotels). This is the guy on first name basis with the musical greats. And
            most
            importantly, this is the guy who pulled <a href="https://youtu.be/EIz8nlyQNJY">the biggest finesse in the
                music
                industry</a> (I’d like to go deeper on Frank, but that’s an entire article by
            itself).

        <h4>You’re a Nerd</h4>

        <p>This is something I’ve been told so many times over the years. At first, I tried to run from it. Because
            people
            attach such labels to things they don’t understand. To things that are separate from them, separate from
            ‘the
            norm’. Its a way of casting people out. And I wanted the opposite. But if the above examples are anything to
            go
            by, its that ‘the norm,’ for the most part, means being lost in the crowd. Cultivate your nerdiness. You'll
            be a
            lot happier. Shut it down, you'll turn bitter and resentful. Because doing so would be a betrayal to who you
            are. And when you do, the world might not like it. It might try to shut you down. But if you are true to
            yourself, it won’t matter. You open your mouth, and people will listen. It takes a lot more energy to fit in
            than to be different. But don't be different for the sake of it, because it's the only to stand out. Be
            different because that's who you are. Because unless you let these imposed limits go, you're an astronaut
            who
            brought your wallet.</p>
