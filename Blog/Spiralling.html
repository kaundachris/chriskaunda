        <p><em class="intro">How low can it go? At some point, it’s got to come back, right? Right?</em></p>

        <p>Its officially a year since I started this investment journey. And what a rollercoaster of a year it has
            been!
            If you had told me this was how it was going to go, I think I would have chosen another path. It has been
            hell.
            Bad news after bad news, market drop after market drop. New low after new low. Eventually you become numb to
            it.
            I have thought of cashing out a couple of times, but this was at least a five-year project. So no, I’ll HODL
            (yes, I’m a <a
                href="https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/the-wallstreetbets-glossary-a-field-guide-to-apes-stonks-tendies-AMC-GME-reddit/">Wallstreetbets
                Ape</a>!).
            I’m not sure if this will be helpful to anyone reading this, but I’ll push it out anyways. This is the story
            of
            the downward spiral - so far. Lord knows when it ends!</p>

        <h4>HODL baby!</h4>

        <p>As of writing this article, my brokerage account says I’m down 24%. Yes, 24%. I’m only a percentage point off
            the S&P 500. I own a lot of tech stocks - something I’m slowly fixing - so a more relevant comparison would
            be
            to the NASDAQ, which is down 34% since I started. Good, since I’m 10% off that number, but bad too, because
            24%!
            I could have put my money into a money market fund and earned 9-11% over the past year. Instead, I’m 30
            percentage points in the opposite direction. At some point in the last three months, I came back all the way
            to
            breakeven. There was a rally that lasted for a month or so. I felt like a genius! And then it started
            crashing
            again. One of the things I did wrong was to dump a huge amount of money into the stock market at once. Early
            in
            the year. When things looked rosy. And the Russia happened. And then inflation happened. And so far, it’s
            been
            one thing after the other. Well, how else do I get to raise my nose and say I went through one of the worst
            years in the stock market, eh!</p>

        <h4>Crypto, oh crypto!</h4>

        <p>I stopped looking at crypto numbers a few months ago. I got tired. See, I first invested in crypto on the 3rd
            of
            January - yes, I remember it pretty well. Since then, crypto is down anywhere between 40% and 60%. Luckily,
            I
            didn’t dump a huge amount of money at once, compared to stocks. But it’s been painful either way. There was
            the
            <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/09/20/what-really-happened-to-luna-crypto/?sh=75058c984ff1">Terra/Luna
                collapse</a>.
            Then came the Celsius fiasco. Then the bankruptcies of Three Arrows Capital. Bad news after bad news. A few
            days
            ago, I told a friend of the losses I’ve had in crypto, and his face said it all. I’ve looked at the numbers
            long
            enough to not think it’s a big deal. Its whenever I mention it to someone - and get their reaction - when I
            realize that it is bad. But as with stocks, this was at least a five-year project. I’m only 20% of the way
            there. Who knows what the other 80% of the journey looks like. It may be bad, worse even. Or it may get
            better.
            Only time will tell.
        </p>

        <p>The one thing about crypto is that I can’t buy anymore - my bank won’t let me. I recently had my account
            flagged
            and closed and had to certify that I wasn’t going to continue buying crypto from my account if I wanted it
            reinstated. That was an awkward scenario that reminded me one thing - banks are not your friends!</p>

        <h4>Noise, lots of noise!</h4>

        <p>At first, I was checking the performance of the S&P 500 almost every hour. I was looking at my portfolio
            every
            two hours. I had become obsessive with the news cycle such that that was all I could think about. First
            thing in
            the morning, check the news on the market. I was following a bunch of Youtubers in the finance space, and
            boy
            were they having fun. You see, bad and tragic news sells a lot more than good news. I you happened to search
            ‘Crypto’ or ‘Stocks’ or ‘Housing Market’, you’d be bombarded with red thumbnails with over-the-top headlines
            and
            anecdotes. It’s what information theorists would call noise. And I drowned myself in it for a while. I
            needed to
            know if this or that would have a negative impact on my stock portfolio. And what that negative effect would
            be.
            I had forgotten - it seems - why I had bought the stocks in the first place. I had forgotten that short term
            news has little to no effect on my strategy, as my holding period is at least 3 years.</p>

        <h4>Applying a filter</h4>

        <p>One of the best things that the downward spiral has given me is the ability to filter out what’s important in
            the long term and what isn’t. After drowning myself in the noise for a time, I realized that news cycles are
            more interested in views than anything else. I also realized that if it’s on the news cycle, then it’s
            probably
            already priced into the stock. I had just come off of reading a book on information theory and realized the
            parallels between that field and investing (with anything really). The first thing I did was delete my
            investment apps. All of them. Coinbase, Interactive Brokers. All gone. The rule was to only add them back to
            my
            phone on the specific date when I do my monthly buying. After that, I delete them, and only add them back a
            month later, when I’m buying again. During the breaks, I learnt not to pay attention to daily price
            movements
            outside of any big news that is hard to miss. I also limited the number of times I look at the broad market
            performance to twice a day - once at the open and once at the close. I don’t even bother with the articles
            explaining the day’s movements as I’ve realized that they usually don’t have as much solid information as
            you’d
            think.</p>

        <h4>Developing the habit</h4>

        <p>During the monthly downtime when I’m not actively tracking the movements of the stock market, I usually do
            research. A lot of research. This has helped in creating the beginnings of a strategy in my investments.
            When I
            started, a lot of the investing I did was based on pop culture discussions. ‘This stock is going to the
            moon!’.
            ‘This stock has 10X potential’. However, limiting my exposure to such information (read ‘noise’) has allowed
            me
            to develop a method of investing. I’ve started going through the 10K filings of the companies I own, and of
            companies I’m interested in owning. I’ve developed a nose for quality attributes of a company, and
            potentially
            catastrophic qualities. I’ve developed a pattern of thought. This allows me enough time to develop
            conviction on
            a stock. And the end result is that when I do eventually buy a company, I know what I’m buying. There are no
            surprises. I’ve basically created habits around my investments, and if you’ve read any self help book in the
            last five years, you know that the ultimate goal is to create a habit out of everything good.</p>

        <h4>And finally…</h4>

        <p>I’m 24% poorer. Not 100% poorer. That, in and of itself, is an achievement I can’t overlook. I’ve had
            discussions with people over the last few months where they recount situations where they lost all of their
            investments on one go. The fact that I’m still in the game gives me the opportunity to claw back some of
            those
            losses. As it has been said before, time in the market beats timing the market. As I have continued to buy,
            I
            have continued to reduce my cost basis. This means that even a small rally will balloon the return on my
            portfolio (Imagine you buy a pen - as prices go down - at $6, $4, and $2. Your cost basis is $4 - total cost
            of
            $12 divide by 3 pens owned. So even if the pen goes back to $4, and not the initial $6, you’re already at
            break-even. If it goes back to $6, you're at 50% return!). This is however contingent on the markets coming
            back. This is not always the case (read on <a
                href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth-investing/are-we-heading-into-another-lost-decade-of-investing">The
                Lost
                Decade</a>).
            But hey, I can still get something back from my investments. Just 24% less. That’s better than nothing.
            Right?
            Right? Until next time!</p>
