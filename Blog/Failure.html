        <p><em class="intro">Failure - especially repeated failure - enables you to learn a lot faster.</em></p>

        <p>I’ve been playing guitar for the last two and a half years. Trying to learn anything at any age past 25 just
            feels like torture. You try doing something - sometimes over and over - but keep on failing. It’s incredibly
            frustrating. You look at what the tutorial tells you to do. But you try it and fail. Miserably. But here’s
            the
            most counter-intuitive thing I’ve come across in the last five years: Failure - especially repeated failure
            -
            enables you to <a
                href="https://www.waterford.org/education/why-failure-is-better-than-success-for-learning/">learn a lot
                faster</a>. You will keep on
            picking the wrong strings, over and over, until eventually you pick the right one. And that dopamine hit
            fuels
            you as you try and hit the next note correctly. Eventually, you learn. But you have to build in enough time
            for
            repeated trials and errors that get you from hitting the wrong strings to hitting the right ones. I’ll
            repeat
            that. You have to build in enough time to go from hitting the wrong strings to hitting the right ones.
            Luckily,
            at our age, we have the luxury of making mistakes. That’s because we have plenty of time to recover from
            failures, provided they are not catastrophic.</p>

        <h4>Don’t Impale Yourself</h4>

        <p>The last line of the above paragraph is extremely important. You can make mistakes, so long as they don’t
            permanently impale you. For this, you need to have a pretty protected environment that allows you to
            experiment
            safely. It should allow for some level of damage control in case things go south. The key here is to have
            what
            investors call a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp">Stop Loss</a>. This is a
            mechanism that
            ensure your losses are capped to a specific amount, after which it gets you out of the trade completely.
            This
            mechanism looks very different from person to person, environment to environment. Since this is an
            investor's
            blog, I’ll let you in on the mechanisms for making mistakes that I’m building into my portfolio.</p>

        <h4>Buy The Basket</h4>

        <p>About 50% of my portfolio is purely in <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-index-funds/">index
                funds</a> (I’m
            increasing this proportion with time). Plain old boring index funds. I do this because index funds are
            probably
            the most diversified instruments in the stock market, especially total market index funds. One of the major
            mistakes I made when I started investing was going tech heavy. This meant that when one stock in my
            portfolio
            went down, all of the rest followed. A piece of bad news on one stock in the advertising space. Well all the
            rest followed as most tech stocks have an advertising component to their businesses. Index funds also help
            to
            ensure no one stock hits your portfolio too much on the low side. The disadvantage to this is that its the
            same
            effect on the upside.</p>

        <p>In the Intelligent Investor, Benjamin Graham says that most people are passive investors, and should ensure
            more
            than 80%-90% of their money is in index funds. This is because the normal person doesn’t have the time to
            sift
            through company data to select the most promising stock. Its a full time job. And besides, passive investing
            in
            index funds, over a period of over ten years, outperforms active investing. This leaves room to experiment
            with
            stock picking, which is a risky game with large potential losses. But they will always be buffered by the
            index
            funds.</p>

        <h4>Stuff Here, Stuff There, Stuff Everywhere</h4>

        <p>One thing I’ve realized is that we, as people, will always want things. So long as there is the concept of
            ‘better’, we will always go for it. Its a hard impulse to ignore. And I’m banking on it. We complain about
            climate change, but won’t stop buying stuff - stuff we usually don’t need. We can say something’s addictive,
            but
            still continue using it. People will always want stuff, and thus there will always be companies that make
            the
            stuff people want. I’m therefore invested in companies that provide products that have become essential in
            our
            daily lives. So long as we have some social pressure to have a phone, clothes, to listen to music and shows,
            I
            will always have some money invested in these companies. These companies will mostly have long lives, and
            will
            continue to exist at some price, even if lower that the prices enjoyed before. AT&T has been around for more
            than 100 years. Ford too. IBM too. And a 100 other companies. Many of those that aren’t around were
            acquired.
            The rest vanished. My hope is that I’m picking up the IBMs and the AT&T of this generation.</p>

        <h4>Hurt Me, And I’ll Hurt You</h4>

        <p>Someone asked me why I wasn’t worried that all my money would disappear. I had to stop and think about it a
            little. Then I realized that for this to happen, the entire US stock market would need collapse. If that
            were to
            happen, then most other international stock market would collapse too. And the effects would trickle down to
            other asset classes such as property, and commodities. That would mean a great deal of wealth would be wiped
            out
            from the population. Trillions in fact. If this were to happen, it would mean the end of civilization as we
            know
            it. The end of capitalism. And I, an investor, wouldn’t be the only one in pain. While I’m not proud of
            this, I
            know for a fact that governments would probably try to <a
                href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bailout.asp">bail us
                out</a>. Because of that fact, I’m a little at ease. Besides, the
            US is the single largest economy in the world, with the largest commercial banks in the world, and with the
            world’s reserve currency. If they fail, we’re all in trouble.</p>

        <h4>Cash Is King</h4>

        <p>I only invest a proportion of my income on a monthly basis. This means I always have a cash buffer that I can
            deploy when the opportunity arises. Even if the stock market goes up in flames, I still have some money to
            get
            me through. This has a major advantage in that it has allowed me, during this bear market, to continue
            buying.
            Its like snatching up bargains in the market, left and right. The rule I’ve adopted it to have anywhere
            between
            20% and 40% of your wealth in cash. Bad things happen, which require one to have some cash lying around. A
            medical emergency, a deal on a property, a treat for yourself and the people you love. Having cash will
            ensure
            that you are able to move with speed when any of this happens. And if you’re thinking of reaching out for a
            loan? The answer is no. It’ll only serve to reduce these advantages. And there’s only about 5 people in my
            life
            I’d make this sacrifice for.</p>

        <p>I’m aware that these stop losses aren’t entirely fool proof. I can personally pick out five weaknesses in my
            reasoning. But they are sufficient for now, and allow me the time and environment to experiment, fail, and
            therefore learn. I’d advice you find your own stop losses, and implement them as soon as possible. Future
            you
            may be extremely thankful. Until the next one!</p>
