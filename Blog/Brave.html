    <div class="content">
        <p>In 2013, a game studio called Naughty Dog released a game called <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tPWmSwuJXU&list=WL&index=6" target="_blank">The Last of
                Us</a>, a game that is probably the most influential
            thing in gaming in the last 30 years. It’s world, and it’s main story, in my opinion, is one that is filled
            with
            fear. The fear of loss. In the first game, Joel is a man that has been broken by loss. Broken each time he
            had
            to lose someone. And broken each time he had to make someone lose. It’s a story of death by a thousand cuts.
            Joel represents the last of the people that remember the world before. The world that wasn’t broken. The
            world
            that wasn’t governed by fear. But then he meets Ellie. This sweet, innocent, but at the same time brash
            little
            girl, that reminds him of someone he had lost before. A girl that doesn’t remember the world before. And at
            first, he resists. He resists feeling. He resists feeling because, in this world he lives in, he knows loss
            is
            around the corner. And he’s afraid of going through it again. But at the end of the first game, he makes a
            choice. An indefensible choice. But a choice nonetheless. A choice based on love. He had allowed himself to
            feel
            again.</p>

        <p>But love and fear are just a degree separated. And its a choice that, in the second game, leads to the very
            thing he was afraid of. Loss. Loss of the person he now loved. In the most poignant scene of the second
            game,
            Ellie berates Joel for making that choice for her. For not letting her life matter. She doesn’t consider
            that
            her life did matter. It mattered to him. Selfish of him, yes. He knows it. It’s in his body language. He
            feels
            shame. But in it we get the last glimpse of the old defiant Joe. Here in the last conversation he was ever
            going
            to have with Ellie, there was a sense of confidence. He is sure in what he is saying. “If somehow the lord
            gave
            me the chance in that moment, I would do it, all over again.”</p>

        <h4>The Fear of Rejection</h4>

        <p>When I started this blog, only a handful of people knew about it. I didn’t know exactly what I was going to
            do
            with it. I was writing, and keeping it to myself. Those who knew kept asking me to share it. But I resisted.
            My
            sister at one time said something that made me reconsider. She said “art is meant to be seen.” A pretty
            compelling argument. And still, I resisted. For seven months straight, I had a blog that no one knew about.
            Why
            was I resisting? Fear. I was afraid that if I shared it, people would reject it. Especially the people close
            to
            me. I wasn’t even afraid of the loud rejection. Just the silent type. The type where the people you expect
            to
            care don’t (as you can tell, I have a history with rejection, but that’s a story for another day). But I was
            at
            a point where I think I had been a coward for so long. And I didn’t want to be a coward anymore. And the
            only
            way to get over my cowardice was through exposure therapy. Do the thing that scares you the most. Expose
            yourself to rejection.</p>

        <p>I hadn’t ever posted a WhatsApp status ever. Like ever. I posted one sharing an article early 2023. I hadn’t
            been on social media for seven years straight. That month, I made my first LinkedIn post. And while what I
            did
            may seem trivial now, it was scary as hell. It took all of me to do these things. I couldn’t sit down for
            hours
            after I had posted. But it was done. I had crossed what seemed like an insurmountable hurdle. And I came out
            the
            other side seemingly fine. And from then on, that fear, while still there, had lost some of its lustre.</p>

        <h4>Of Switches Turning On</h4>

        <p>Having something we care deeply about grounds us. For most men, we go a long time with nothing to really care
            about. But I believe there’s a certain subset of men for whom a switch turns on, and never turns off. It’s
            the
            switch that makes you realize that there’s a slim chance - a very slim one - that you can do something
            bigger
            than yourself. You see it. You see it clearly. And once you see it, you can’t unsee it. But in the process
            of
            satrting to do it, you realize some things. First, that to achieve this goal, it is going to need you to
            step
            out of your comfort zone and into unknown territory. And there’s few things scarier to man than the unknown.
            That’s why we build homes. Have the same friends. Date the same people (not literally, but figuratively).
            It’s
            familiar and known. And stepping into the unknown inflicts a certain amount of fear. Second, you realize
            that
            you are going to have to carry a burden like no other to achieve this goal. A burden that you’re not sure
            you
            can carry. That inflicts another kind of fear. Finally, you realize that it is going to be painful if you
            fail.
            And if you’re smart, you will know that the odds of failure far overwhelm the odds of success. And that
            inflicts
            another fear, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YKjkuz5JS0E" target="_blank">the fear of failure</a>.
        </p>

        <p>So, you are unsure as to whether to go after that vision you have. A logical man will chose not to. The odds
            are
            overwhelmingly stacked against you. You are probably going to fail. But that switch doesn’t function on
            logic or
            reason. And it doesn’t turn off. It is the closest thing to the voice of God than many men will ever hear.
            There
            are usually fifty reasons not to do something. There is usually one reason to do it. You’ve got to weight
            them
            out. Because there’s pain either way. There is a lot of pain in not trying. Choose which one you can live
            with.</p>

        <h4>The Fear of Criticism</h4>

        <p>A few months into sharing this blog, another kind of fear kicked in. A fear that made me want to quit. It
            began
            as the fear of misinterpretation. I have written a few articles where someone has come to me with their
            understanding of what I mean. And it has sometimes been completely different from what I intended. Its
            mostly
            attributable to my writing style, which is sometimes abstract and seemingly scattered. It made me worry that
            there might be a case where something I said is highly misinterpreted. And that’s a dangerous thing in this
            cancel culture environment. But I got to terms with it. If I obsessed over interpretation, I’d never write.
            And
            that, to me, would be to give my power, my gift away. It would be submitting to the fear.</p>

        <p>And then I got criticized. And it wasn’t a subtle criticism. It was a detailed one. And one of those
            criticisms
            that you can’t argue away. At least not to yourself. And that hurt my ego, way more than I thought it would.
            Because in that moment, I entertained the fact that I wasn’t as good a person as I thought I was. This
            destabilized me for a while. It is emotionally harder to accept you are wrong than it is to believe that you
            are
            right. It created a form of PTSD for a time after that, where I was trying to figure out how to go about
            writing
            in a way that avoids that kind of criticism. My ego wasn’t sound enough to take those kinds of hits. Even
            after
            all that work to get rid of the fear, it was still there. Insidious as always.</p>

        <h4>Fear and Anger</h4>

        <p>When you chase an animal, say a cat, it will run away in fear. And it will run so long as there is space to
            run.
            But if you corner the cat, such that it has nowhere for it to go, the cat will turn that fear into anger.
            And it
            will use this anger to fight back. To fight for its life. Wherever there is fear, there is anger. Anger
            suppresses fear. Anger can be a good outlet for the fear. Like Eminem said, <a
                href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6ogACNVtzSJHzqLhzUegaf?si=c0ecec5479fb4dda" target="_blank">when
                life’s a drag,
                don’t cry, get
                mad</a>. But this is only if done
            carefully. Because anger, just like fear, has spillover effects that can easily affect everyone around you.
            On a
            few occasions, I have turned fear into anger. This has the effect of pushing you two steps forward, one step
            back. Anger provides a level of drive that is hard to get any other way. And if used well, it does help in
            getting a lot done. Some of the stuff I’m most proud of came from a point of fear and dread, and thus anger.
            Fear that the world is what it is, not what I want it to be. That people are who they are, not what I want
            them
            to be. But it can lead to some missteps, where you find yourself doing something you don’t particularly like
            or
            want. There is stuff that I’ve written - things that I’ve done - out of anger and frustration. Stuff that
            I’d do
            a little different now. But it was because I didn’t take time to articulate the fear. To face that fear.</p>

        <h4>Integrating Fear</h4>

        <p>Fear is incredibly salient in us. Our brains are tuned to it. It signifies danger. When we hear a twig
            breaking
            behind us in the dark, we don’t think “that’s my friend, Mark.” We immediately go into fight or flight mode.
            But
            this is wiring that worked for us in the wilderness. We’ve been out of it for thousands of years. Fear, in
            todays world, is a lot less important. And I’ve found that when we turn around and face that fear, it often
            disappears. Into the ether. Like smoke. When it doesn’t, then you have a wonderful opportunity to integrate
            the
            fear. To sit with it. To find out what exactly it is saying. And integrate it into what you do going
            forward.
            Your fear will show you where to step carefully. You can’t ignore fear. It exists for a reason. It is
            telling
            you something about the environment, and about yourself. The bravest you can be is not to others, but to
            yourself. To sit by yourself and listen to the worst voices in your head. To stop running from yourself.
            Because
            if you run from yourself, you are always going to be running. As for me, I listened to the fear. And my
            answer
            to it was a line from <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/74NI58MQexwZjNu1Gu6GjT?si=6e54b9a93cc44236"
