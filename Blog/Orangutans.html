        <p>In the aftermath of the earthquake in Turkey, people asked scientists why they couldn’t predict the
            earthquake.
            Why - with all the expensive equipment, the brilliant minds - didn’t they didn’t see it coming? And the
            scientists gave a very curious answer. They said that they can predict an earthquake is going to happen, say
            three hours from now. What they can’t predict is the size of the earthquake. That’s weird. If you can
            predict
            the earthquake, it’s just a small step to predicting its size, right? But this taps into a concept that’s a
            bit
            confusing, even for me. In chaos theory, it’s called
            <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/non-deterministic">non-determinism</a>. And the
            gist of it is
            simple. For a complex system (complex being anything that has a wide variety of factors acting together),
            the
            same trigger that causes a small event is the same trigger that causes a large event. Think of two people
            coming
            from the same family, but one turning into a billionaire, and the other turning into a deadbeat. In Turkey’s
            case, the trigger for a small earthquake was the same trigger for a big earthquake. So as the scientist
            observing this, you can identify that a trigger has occurred, and know an earthquake is coming. You just
            don’t
            know whether it’s a big one or a small one.
        </p>

        <h4>Outliers</h4>

        <p>See, for any system, there will always be outliers - really successful people in this case. And these
            successful
            people will always get one question. ‘What’s the path to success?’ And they will
            always have an answer. Something along the lines of work hard, pray, be smart, work hard some more, and
            boom!
            Success! And it’s a path that’s been laid out by so many times, you’d wonder why it ever gets asked. But
            here’s
            the thing. If their path to success - the one they keep on preaching in seminars, talks and interviews -
            actually worked, then it should be replicable, right? And there should be a lot more people with the same
            level
            of success - or at least getting there - right? But the <a
                href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/sep/09/inequality-is-it-rising-and-can-we-reverse-it">wealth
                gap</a> is actually
            rising. And the <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/distribution-of-global-wealth-chart/">percentage
                of wealthy
                people</a> - relatively speaking - is still
            the same, if not dropping. If it works, why are there more of us than them? Here’s the thing: deep down, you
            know whatever answer they give is bullshit. You might not want to admit it, but you know. You do. You only
            listen to them because you idolize them. You assume them experts. And they know they can say anything, and
            you’ll eat it up.</p>

        <h4>Riding The Wave</h4>

        <p>There’s a tech Youtuber by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd">Marquess Brownlee</a> who
            attributes his
            success mainly to ‘riding the wave.’ Of course, there’s the aspect of hard work and all. But in one of his
            videos, he plainly says that he just happened to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCCBDhdcSGw">at
                the top of a
                wave</a>, and he just rode it. YouTube was just about to explode in
            popularity. Smartphones and technology in general were about to explode. These gadgets were about to stop
            being
            tools, and more like extensions of ourselves. The choice of phone was now more important than it had ever
            been
            before. And he just happened to be making videos on this same topic - just happened being the key words
            here.
            Why? It wasn’t because he knew it was going to be big. It wasn’t because he had a master plan to become the
            biggest tech youtuber. He was a geek, and he liked doing it. Simple. And as he was doing it, he got caught
            perfectly in the wave. Now, there were millions of youtubers even then, and probably hundreds in the same
            space
            of tech. There were probably tens of people doing the same exact thing he was doing. Probably working harder
            than he was. But they we’re off by just a little, either to the left or to the right of the wave. And they
            got
            swallowed by the wave. They got sent to the graveyard.</p>

        <p>If you go and look at the billionaire index today, among the things you’ll notice is that it is full of tech
            billionaires. If you were to ask me, while these people worked their asses off to get to where they are, the
            main factor in their success is that they rode the wave better than anyone else. Tech was just about to hit
            the
            ground running. The internet was about to become the center of our lives. The internet back then is what
            ChatGPT
            and AI is today. A whole new frontier to what’s possible. The possibilities were endless. But even in a
            world of
            endless possibilities, only a few survive the test of time. And as with non-determinism, companies in the
            same
            field, doing essentially the same things, had entirely different outcomes. Google is a behemoth today. Yahoo
            only exists on the fringes. Facebook basically owns social media. Myspace, along with others like 2Go
            (remember
            this!) are dead. The groundwork for Spotify was laid by Napster. And companies like Netflix owe their
            success to
            Pirate Bay. Of the thousands of promising startups in the 90’s, only a handful - literally a handful -
            remain
            today. The rest got sent to the graveyard.</p>

        <h4>The Graveyard</h4>

        <p>Someone created a website dedicated to every <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">project that Google has
                killed</a>. And
            if you go look at the contents, you’ll be super shocked at the number of projects that are on there. Why
            would
            Google dedicate so much time to developing a product, then kill it? Well, it’s because Google understand
            non-determinism pretty well. They know that for every hundred projects they invest in, only one or two will
            turn
            out to be successes. It’s a matter of setting off as many triggers as they can. 95% of the time, they’ll
            turn a
            Google Hangouts, Google Glass or Google Duo. But if they try hard enough, they’ll eventually land on a
            Gmail,
            YouTube or Google Ads. And the successes are not exactly the ones they expect. There’ll be projects they
            have
            high hopes for that just don’t work. And there’ll be others that blow up to billion dollar companies, almost
            completely unexpected. Just read <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCPjk8Tpb5c&list=PLQ-uHSnFig5Nd98Sc9I-kkc0ZWe8peRMC&index=18">the
                story of how Gmail
                started</a> and
            you’ll see what I mean.</p>

        <h4>Rich Spirit</h4>

        <p>We don’t like to look at the graveyard. It’s cold, dark and depressing. And most of all, it’s scary. It’s a
            reminder of the reality that no matter how far we run, we’re always the same distance from the ditch. In a
            world
            so obsessed with pleasure, happiness and fulfillment, who would want to pay attention to the graveyard? Why
            let
            ourselves go into withdrawal when we can jump on the next high? We’d rather chase the hedonistic fantasy,
            even
            though there’s an overwhelming chance that we won’t ever get it. And without realizing it, this chase for
            pleasure only ends in pain. Maybe that’s being human. Having hope. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t chase
            after
            whatever you want. I’m not that big of an asshole (hard to believe given the last few articles). All I’m
            saying
            is that there’s a lot of hindsight bias in the advice successful people give. Kendrick, in ‘<a
                href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1QPreu0BNOrUfEb8HTd2qG?si=c65110a7034d4acd">Rich
                Spirit</a>,’ states that ‘celebrity does
            not mean integrity.’ These people don’t know as much as you think they do. There’s an assumption that their
            path
            is replicable. But their wave has already passed, and taken its casualties with it. You just have to find
            your
            wave, and hope to hell you can ride it.</p>
