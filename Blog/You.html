    <h3>December 2023</h3>

    <h1 class="centre">You</h1>

    <div>
        <p><em class="intro">I’m not in love. I tell myself this. Until you validate me. Then I can’t live without
                you</em></p>

        <p>It’s you. It’s always been you. You’re as good as it gets for me. Without you, I’m a shell of a person. I
            realize that I can’t live - actually live - if you’re not with me a hundred percent. If you are not in the
            correct state to lead me. I cannot know what is right if you don’t. I can’t get my shit together if you
            don’t.
            Without you everything loses meaning. Everything I do is influenced by you. Of the three pillars you and I
            have,
            you are arguably the most important. And if you have the best interest in yourself, you will have the best
            interest for me too. And therefore I need you to do the simple thing for me, Chris. And simple it is, but at
            the
            same time the most difficult thing you’ll ever have to do. I need you to get our shit together. I need you
            to
            keep your house in order.</p>

        <h4>The Pressure Cooker</h4>

        <p>When something needs to be dealt with, you normally postpone it to later. Conflict. Confrontation. A wild
            thought. You tell yourself that you’ll do it when the time is right. When you have time to. Even if the
            thing
            will take you less than five minutes, and you know it would probably be easier if you dealt with it there
            and
            then. No. You push it forward. And you do this again. And again. And again. Until the list of things to be
            done
            gets so long. And now the small thing from before becomes worrying. Because you worry that if you start with
            that one thing, it will lead to a cascade of other things that need to be dealt with. A cascade of things
            that
            will take forever to deal with. A cascade of things you are afraid of. Pain. Fear. Anxiety. While they were
            once
            minute and easy, they have grown into something big and scary. And so you postpone it again. And without
            knowing
            it, it builds up, causing a more insidious pain, fear and anxiety. The mental load gets heavier and heavier
            each
            day. A pressure cooker that is getting hotter by the moment, waiting to pop.</p>

        <h4>Clean Your Room.</h4>

        <p>Get in the practice of keeping your house in order. It’s a simple thing. The person who said it - the person
            who
            has helped you quite a lot - has gotten a lot of stick for it. Because it seemed to be that he was
            simplifying
            things a little bit too much. But goddamn was the man right. There’s a reason people in the military are
            trained
            on the basics. Make your bed. Shine your shoes. You have tried it. And you get why he said to start with
            your
            room. Because its fucking hard. But you have seen the benefits. By keeping your house in order, you have
            gotten
            to know where everything is. And that, by extension, gives you access to everything you use regularly and
            quickly. You get to identify exactly what’s actually missing. And the mere identification of what’s missing
            is
            extremely important. You get to know exactly where to find the missing thing. A house in order declutters.
            And
            by doing so, opens up your mental palace. So that you see more clearly what you need. And what you don’t.
        </p>

        <h4>Change Your World</h4>

        <p>It’s not going to be easy, keeping your house in order. Not at all. I fact, I dare you to do it for a week.
            Not
            a year. Not a month. A week. Before you go about ‘changing the world,’ just keep everything in order for a
            week.
            See how hard it is. And when you realize that it’s not easy, remember that ‘changing the world’ is going to
            be
            infinitely harder. Sometimes life will seem to not have anything for you. You will sometimes think that it
            just
            wants to fuck you. And when it does, remember that this might probably be the single biggest thing you could
            do
            for yourself. When you are so overwhelmed, the simplest thing might just be picking up that sock that has
            been
            on the floor for three days. It might be washing the cup that has been in the sink all day. It might be
            simply
            making your bed. Change your world, and maybe you can change someone else’s.</p>

        <h4>Of Bad and Good Visitors</h4>

        <p>Remember what your sister said. ‘Make your house somewhere you are proud and eager to go back to at the end
            of
            the day.’ You can’t ever be afraid to go home. The day you are, you have failed yourself. I want to look
            forward
            to talking to you. But I can’t do that if you are a mess. You are one of the biggest investments I will ever
            make. And you are an investment that I am going to continue making. Sure, something will break sometimes.
            Something will get forgotten. You may get a visitor. A bad visitor, from time to time. One that breaks you.
            One
            that leaves you in pain. Don’t let them stay too long though. Make sure to deal with the situation. Pick up
            the
            pieces after they have left. Throw them away. Get your house back in order. Sometimes you will get a good
            visitor. One that shows you what you’ve been missing. If they are staying, let them know that you like keep
            your
            house in order. And they will too.</p>

        <h4>The Drawer and the Sink</h4>

        <p>Refuse the temptation to shove things in the drawer of ‘problems I don’t want to deal with now’, where they
            can’t be seen. Because every time you do this, the drawer gets more full. It gets progressively harder to
            close.
            And eventually, the drawer stops closing, and the clothes spill over. The more you do this, the more it will
            come back to bite you in the future. At some point, you are going to have to look in that drawer. To find
            that
            sock that you need. And it’s going to be easier when the drawer isn’t so full of unmanaged shit. Every once
            in a
            while, open the drawer, examine its contents, and clean it out. Once in a while, go under the sink. Open the
            outlet. Let the gunk out. Don’t be too disgusted by it. It’s your gunk. It will stink you up for a while.
            But if
            you clean the gunk, and you open your windows for fresh air, the stink will be gone sooner rather than
            later.
            And from then on, the cleaning process will get a lot easier. Everything will flow easier. And you’ll be
            happier
            for it.</p>

        <h4>Intermissions of Unhappiness</h4>

        <p>‘This seems like a lot of work! Why do it?’ I hear you ask me. Well, it’s simple. Because you’ve seen worse.
            You’ve been worse. At the same time, you’ve seen what better looks like. And having seen better, you can’t
            unsee
            it. Every time you beat yourself up, it’s because you know you know better. And so you are going to try. You
            are
            going to try, for fuck’s sake. You’re not going to be perfect. That race for perfection is a futile one,
            filled
            with pain. You don’t want to fall into that trap. But you are going to try to be better. Better than you
            were
            yesterday. You fail. Again. And again. And again. But when you do, remember that your happiness requires
            intermissions of unhappiness. It’s okay. Try again. Because you are as good as it gets for me. It’s either
            you
            or nothing. You’re the one person that will always validate me. I can’t live without you. So get your shit
            together. Get your house in order. Do this for me, and I’ll try and be the best that I can be for you.</p>
