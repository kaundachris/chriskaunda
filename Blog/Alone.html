        <p>There’s nothing louder than silence. You can be in a room full of people talking. And not hear a thing they
            say.
            You can go to church, sit through the whole service, and not remember what the teaching was about. You can
            go to
            a club, and drown out the music being played. Our brains are interesting in that they can filter out our
            environment, removing things that aren’t particularly important to us and focusing on things that are.
            That’s
            why you can smell something at first, but <a href="https://youtu.be/n8EvWzWEbz0">not smell it ten minutes
                later</a>. The
            smell may still be there, but you have to refocus on it to recognize its still there. That’s why we turn
            down
            the volume of the radio when were looking for something. We’re refocusing from the auditory system - the
            music -
            to the visual system - the looking. And the thing about noise is that it can provide a level of distraction,
            especially when there’s something you don’t want to deal with. You just shift your focus to the noise.
            Silence,
            on the other hand, doesn’t distract. It just sits there. You hear it loud and clear. And soon, it gets
            overbearing. And silence is a lot more overbearing than noise. Anytime you’re going through something, you
            have
            one of two choices. Turn your focus inward (your internal noise), or turn up any source of external noise
            you
            can find.</p>

        <h4>Taking the Edge Off</h4>

        <p>I’m willing to bet that 95% of the time, <a
                href="https://theconversation.com/bring-the-noise-has-technology-made-us-scared-of-silence-10988">we
                turn to external
                noise</a>. Its easily
            accessible. It requires little to no effort at all. Put Netflix on, and watch a show you’ve already watched
            before. Put on a comedy. It’ll make you laugh when nothing else can. Turn up the music. Put on a song you’ve
            listened to a million times. It makes you feel better. For my parent’s generation, its the news. My dad will
            put
            on the news, and not even watch it. It just serves as background noise. For some in our generation, its
            games.
            Candy Crush, FIFA, or anything else that can swallow your attention. And for most, its social media.
            Endlessly
            scrolling to see what people we don’t care about are doing.</p>

        <p>Just in case you think I’m being a dick, I do the same. For me its working on something. It could be work
            itself, it could be projects that are simply a waste of time, or watching content such as YouTube videos and
            podcasts. We live in a world where we have what are basically hard drugs in our pockets, everywhere we go.
            Are
            you standing in line? Well you can take in the moment. Think about something. Or you can pull out your
            phone.
            Scroll up, then down. Look like there’s something you’re doing. Sometimes not for anyone’s sake but
            yourself.
            Are you in a group of people who barely know each other? Respond to a text you don’t even want to respond
            to.
            Look like you have a normal life.</p>

        <h4>Always The Same Distance From The Ditch.</h4>

        <p>The alternative - turning inwards - is a fucking nightmare in and of itself. Internal noise is hard to deal
            with. It means dealing with repressed issues that we’d rather not deal with. Things that are embarrassing.
            Scary. Things that in a way say something contrary to who we think we are. Things that create an intense and
            visceral feeling. And who the fuck wants to deal with that. Its a lot of work! We barely have the tools to
            deal
            with these experiences ourselves. Kinyozi hajinyoi. Why deal with it <a
                href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9503-we-use-tv-as-we-use-tranquilizers--to-even-things">when I
                can
                watch</a> Big Mouth? Why
            do that when I can go hang out with my friends. Why do that when I can drink and not think about it?</p>

        <p>But ignoring it doesn’t mean its gone. Its still there. Your body knows it. It feels it’s weight like a bag
            of
            sand. And its a matter of time before it comes out. It’s no wonder we are the most depressed generation. We
            have
            access to so much external noise that we barely have time to deal with internal noise. At least not until it
            brings us down to our knees. Not before we burn out. Not before we experience a mental breakdown. Drink
            ourselves to rehab. Get ourselves in a bad situation. And even then the silence is usually short-lived. As
            soon
            as we have one foot out, we’re flooded with noise again.</p>

        <h4>Don’t Go Where I Can’t Follow</h4>

        <p>Separation. That’s the theme of the second half of your 20’s. That’s is what I’m told. And god are they
            right.
            The main realizations for this part of your young adulthood is that everyone you know is on a different path
            from yours. There’s a selfishness in us of wanting everyone to follow a path where we maintain what’s
            familiar.
            The friendship. The hanging out. But those who truly care will understand that it not possible. That that
            person
            you truly care about, will at one point go <a href="https://youtu.be/nLN1lUtwMzQ">somewhere where you can’t
                follow</a>.
            Painful as it is. And that creates a level of silence that hasn’t been there for a long time, maybe ever. As
            a
            child, your parents were your fulcrum. And from the teenage years to your early 20’s your friends played
            this
            role, for better or worse. Past that however, that gap grows. Maybe that’s why many get married in this
            latter
            part of the 20’s.</p>

        <h4>Pain and Love</h4>

        <p>A couple of close people in my life have taken paths that, while wonderful, meant creating some distance. And
            what that has meant is that, all of a sudden, there’s a lot of silence in my life. I consider myself a
            solitary
            animal, but even this is a lot for me. And its forcing me into a choice between either external noise or
            internal noise. I’m choosing to go internal. To go into my cocoon. ‘Chris’ cocoon,’ as one of the smartest
            people I know calls it. Its not the place I want to be in right now. But I think it necessary. And I’m still
            leaving room for external noise, as I think it ensures you don’t get lost in yourself.</p>

        <p>A friend of mine recently used a term I really liked. ‘Social bird.’ I’m not one. Never have been. Its a
            factor
            of some experiences I had as a child (I’ll one day put them on display here, when I’m brave enough. True
            humility is the only antidote to shame). I can be social, but its an active choice. Its not my default. Why
            else
            would I have share these stuff on a blog, when I could just share it with friends. And whenever there’s
            silence
            in my life, I realize there’s a lot of pain. But as Jordan Peterson puts it, pain is a fundamental part of
            existence. But the only thing more fundamental than pain <a
                href="https://youtube.com/shorts/McJR4aFeIMc?feature=share">is
                love</a>. And If you have pain, well then, love and truth.
            That’s what you got.</p>
