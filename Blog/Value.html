        <p>The most well-known value investor today is Warren Buffet. His returns over his lifetime of investing are
            like
            no other out there. Only a few people come close to him. Warren, and in particular his partner Charlie
            Munger,
            are my heroes. I look up to them as the epitome of wealth. Having a shit-ton of it but never letting it
            bother
            or get to you. The way I look at it, their wealth is more of a proof of concept. That their ideas really do
            work. They seem more like scientists to me. Happier in having something actually work. The thing about
            Warren is
            that he is a student of a guy named Benjamin Graham, who is a pioneer of something called value investing.
            His
            book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106835.The_Intelligent_Investor">The Intelligent
                Investor</a>, is close
            to a bible for value investors. A few months ago, I decided to dig into it, to find out what all the fuss
            about
            this book was about. And after reading it, I decided to adjust my investment strategy, gearing it more
            towards
            value investing., In this article, I’ll be going through some of the ideas I use to select stocks. You can
            use
            these individually, or together to narrow down on stocks.</p>

        <h4>Price to Book Ratio</h4>

        <p>The <a
                href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp#:~:text=What%20Is%20the%20Price-to-Book%20\(P%2FB,value%20per%20share%20\(BVPS\).">Price
                to Book
                ratio</a>,
            in simple terms, is the amount you are paying for a company, in relation to the amount of assets it has. If
            you
            pay 10 dollars to a company owning 5 dollars’ worth of assets (buildings, cars, etc.), then you are paying
            two
            dollars per dollar of assets - a Price to Book ratio of 2. Ideally, you want to deduct any intangible assets
            from the total value of assets the company has, such as goodwill. That’s because determining the value of
            these
            is extremely difficult - more an art than science. In value investing, you ideally want to buy a company
            whose
            assets match the amount you are paying to own the company. This means, in an ideal situation (I repeat,
            ideal
            situation), that if the company were ever to go down, you’d at least get back, in assets value, what you
            paid
            for when buying the company. You don’t lose (again, in an ideal situation).</p>

        <p>By buying companies that have a low price to book ratio, you are creating a backstop to the amount of loss
            that
            you can experience when the company goes down. This touches on one of the most important things, especially
            if
            you are a conservative investor: you’d rather minimize risk than maximize outcomes. The downside to this is
            that
            companies that fit this bill are usually industrial companies that require a lot of capital investments just
            to
            run. Most of these companies also tend to have relatively small operating margins, something I pay close
            attention to. This is the complete opposite of something like a tech company, which are usually low on
            assets,
            but very high on margins. But hey, if you can find something that overcomes these two, you’ve probably found
            a
            goldmine.</p>

        <h4>Price to Earnings Ratio</h4>

        <p>The <a
                href="https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/p/pe-ratio-price-earnings-ratio/#:~:text=The%20price%2Fearnings%20ratio%2C%20also,share%20for%20%241%20of%20earnings.">Price
                to Earnings
                ratio</a>
            is basically a ratio of the price you pay compared to the amount of earnings the company generates from its
            business in a specific year. If a company has a PE of 25, that means that you are paying, at that particular
            moment in time, $25 for every dollar the company generated in the most recent full financial year. The most
            basic way to think about this is that it will take the company 25 years - at the current earning power - to
            pay
            you back what you invested in the company. Ideally, you want a lower PE ratio compared to a higher PE ratio.
            Spotify, for example, has a PE ratio of over 200 as at the time of writing this article. This implies it
            will
            take 200 years - 200 YEARS! - for the company to earn you what you paid for it. Most of us will be lucky to
            get
            to 70, leaving a balance of 130 years - and that’s assuming you started investing at birth.</p>

        <p>Most of the companies with low PE ratios are already established companies with more predictable growth. This
            is
            good for those looking for relative security, which is most value investors. These sorts of companies are
            usually less volatile in terms of price movements. They have already established operations, are market
            leaders
            in most respects, and have a competitive advantage that makes them hard to bring down - all good attributes.
            Companies fitting this bill are usually more industrial companies, and a few tech companies that are well
            into
            maturity (i.e., close to market saturation and/or peak growth). The downside is that it invalidates a lot of
            exciting new companies out there, with extreme potentials for growth, and huge potential capital gains. But
            you
            have to pick your poison. Its either relative security paired with low growth, or relative risk paired with
            high
            growth.</p>

        <h4>Current Ratio</h4>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentratio.asp">Current Ratio</a>, in basic terms, is the
            amount of
            current assets a company holds compared to the current liabilities it has. This basically shows how well a
            company can meet its ongoing operational needs (cashflow). A current ratio of more than one means that if
            all
            the current obligations were to come due today, it can easily liquidate its current assets to offset them
            (or
            use its current assets as collateral for determining a payment agreement). If a company has a million in
            payables due, but has 600,000 in cash and 500,000 in stock, it can pay up the cash, and use the stock as
            collateral for the remaining amount. This measure is useful in that it protects the company from forced
            liquidation and other legal issues arising from non-payment of obligations. It also provides assurance that
            the
            company won’t have to sell any of its more valuable assets just to meet some obscure short-term obligation.
            An
            extension of this is the quick ratio, which instead of using its current assets (which might include hard to
            move items such as inventory), uses more liquid assets such as cash and cash equivalents.</p>

        <h4>Sales Growth</h4>

        <p>Another important factor I look at is the sales growth of the company, mostly over 5 years (During this covid
            era, this is becoming a lot harder. You can basically eliminate 2020 and add a previous year for more
            reliable
            numbers). Sales growth, for me at least, represents the ability of the company to sell its product to more
            people, and the usefulness of the product to the people being sold to. You usually buy only the things you
            use/like. So, if a company’s sales are growing, it’s an indicator that the product is useful to people, and
            more
            people want to use it. This is also important in the sector of investing - and capitalism as a whole - where
            more is better! More sales, more profit (ideally), more money for me! The level of growth is based on you
            and
            your appetite. Newer companies in newer industries usually have higher growth trajectories. If you were to
            use
            the above criteria to narrow down on stocks, the number of companies with high growth (’high’ being a
            measure
            you determine) reduces drastically. Remember, value investing tends to gravitate towards already established
            companies, most of which are nearing saturation.</p>

        <h4>In Conclusion</h4>

        <p>There’s a couple more items I use to narrow down the scope of companies to look at. However, this article is
            getting pretty long, so I’ll place a cut-off here, and discuss the rest of the factors in a subsequent
            article.
            These criteria are also pretty stringent and are best for an investor who is more conservative in his/her
            approach. If you want slightly higher returns, you can relax some of these - or drop them entirely. This
            will
            enable you to look at a wider variety of companies and might open up the door to a higher level of return
            -albeit with some increased risk. But as of now, this is what I’m using as a foundation for my investments.
            It
            is helping me in building investment principles and allows me to take it slow. I will adjust my strategy
            over
            time, but it will still be on this foundation. You have to decide where you lie on the spectrum of
            risk/reward.
            Remember, the earlier you start, the higher risk you can take. Until next time!If you had a choice, would
            you
            pay more for something or less?</p>

            will
            enable you to look at a wider variety of companies, and might open up the door to a higher level of return
            -albeit with some increased risk. But as of now, this is what I’m using as a foundation for my investments.
            Its
            helping me in building investment principles, and allows me to take it slow. I will adjust my strategy over
            time, but it will still be on this foundation. You have to decide where you lie on the spectrum of
            risk/reward.
            Remember, the earlier you start, the higher risk you can take. Until next time!</p>
