        <p>We live in a world where polarization is a strategy. Social media thrives on polarization. Its easier to
            serve
            you content if I know what tickles your feathers. And the best way to find that out is to try things that
            are
            naturally polarizing and see which side you choose. And serve you more of that. However, this polarization
            has
            recently entered a concerning area, that of sex (or gender, whichever way you choose to look at it). And its
            causing some really concerning things to come up. Sit down with any group, and the talk about what it means
            to
            be a man or woman today will come up. More often than not, women will complain that there are no men
            anymore.
            That men have forgotten to be men. And in the same vein, men will complain that women are different, no
            longer
            like our mothers, whatever that means. Given that I am male, it raises the question. What does it mean to be
            a
            man?</p>

        <h4>The Modern Woman</h4>

        <p>Something fascinating has happened over the past 20-30 years. Women have been greatly empowered. There are
            more
            women getting educated, graduating from universities, getting employed and climbing the career ladder among
            other things. Some numbers show that the numbers now exceed that of men in some areas. I won’t touch on
            stuff
            like the pay gap. That’s too touchy of an issue (i.e. I don’t want to get cancelled!). But this has created
            a
            socioeconomic status that women, in general, haven’t ever experienced before. Go back one generation - to
            our
            mothers - and the story’s a whole lot different. Women (generalizing here) have more money than before. They
            have more stable careers than before (holding the misogyny they experience in the workplace constant - for
            now).</p>

        <p>My money is mine, and your money is ours. This is a saying that permeates all the discussions on the role of
            the
            man in a relationship. Just listen to Classic in the morning and you’ll hear cases of the wife having a
            stash of
            cash while the kid is home due to a lack of school fees. But its the guy’s job to pay for fees. In a world
            where
            the woman is a lot more capable, her role stays the same. And yours as a man, stays the same. Its like
            nothing
            has changed. No progress has been made. Even as I know that she could very easily take care of a problem for
            me,
            I’m not supposed to ask. I’m not supposed to ‘show weakness.’</p>

        <h4>Cognitive Dissonance</h4>

        <p>As women have become more empowered, some have taken some additional responsibility in step with their
            additional ability/power. Women are now more likely to pay for dates than before. They are more likely to
            raise
            kids by themselves than before. They will do more things that were traditionally male just a generation ago.
            Work, hustle, buy themselves nice things, party, travel. You get the point. They don’t need men to do these
            things for them anymore, at least not as much as before. On top of this is the - in my opinion - toxic
            feminism
            that’s creeping in some female conversations where the general theme is that men are not needed anymore.
            This
            creates two problems. One is cognitive dissonance. Tell anyone something that goes against their beliefs and
            what happens? They deny it, they try to prove you wrong, and finally, when they find that they can’t, they
            completely ignore it. Its like its inconsequential. And that’s what’s happening with men today.</p>

        <p>What happens when the man, who expects to take you out, to take you on trips, sees you providing them for
            yourself? What happens when a man, who expect to be the head of the family, the final say, finds out he’s
            not?
            What happens when a man realizes that he isn’t as powerful as he thought he was? Well, first he’s going to
            deny
            it. ‘Ain’t no way a woman can have all those things,’ he’ll say. ‘Even if she does, women are naturally
            weak,
            and need a man’s guidance,’ he’ll say. When that doesn’t work, he’ll try to prove himself right. He’ll
            forcefully subjugate his wife. He’ll beat her, mistreat her, cheat on her. All ways to forcefully create
            dominance (or an illusion of it), and remind her that she ain’t shit. And finally, he might completely
            ignore
            it, assume your non-importance, and treat you as such.</p>

        <h4>The Manosphere</h4>

        <p>As I said above, polarization is the way of the world today. With the toxic feminism talk going around for
            the
            past few years, there’s naturally been a rise in an opposite and equally shocking discussion on the male
            side.
            As a whole, its called the Manosphere. This includes names such as Andrew Kibe, Kevin Samuels and Andrew
            Tate.
            The same way guys can’t sit down and listen to some feminists talk, is the same way women can’t listen to
            guys
            like Andrew Kibe talk. But here’s the thing we need to be worried about. As much as we want to say that
            these
            guys are toxic, and should be cancelled, and worse, these guys have a massive audience. Massive. Guys you
            wouldn’t think would ever care for such sentiments - sweet guys, good guys - are finding themselves drawn to
            what these ‘toxic’ men are saying. And it is with good reason.</p>

        <p>As bad as this sounds, I’m going to say it. Men no longer have monopoly and control over things that they
            have
            traditionally had control over. Society today tells men that they aren’t as important. It doesn’t
            communicate
            this overtly. It does so subtly. And that is causing men to ask themselves a fundamental question. ‘If I’m
            not
            needed here, then what the fuck am I doing here?’ We don’t know what we’re supposed to do. And women aren’t
            telling us what we’re supposed to be doing. They are busy trying to figure this shit out themselves. And so
            men
            are trying to find ways to re-assert their dominance, because they are told that they are supposed to be
            dominant. But how do you do that in a world where the woman you actually want - ‘actually’ being the key
            word -
            is just as dominant as you are. In comes the manosphere, where you can find all kinds answers to your
            questions
            about the nature of women. But are there any universal answers?</p>

        <h4>And So…</h4>

        <p>What’s currently happening is that the lines are being redrawn. We’ve just had a paradigm shift, and we still
            haven’t fully adopted to it. We still haven’t figured out that the traditional man the traditional woman are
            dead. We’re figuring it out as we go, fumbling in the dark for anything solid to lean on. And until this
            process
            is done, there’s going to be chaos. Single parent families, infidelity, cases of extreme violence, and many
            worse things. This is not an attack on any group of people. Rarely are people entirely right or entirely
            wrong.
            I’m just calling out what I see. But until we regress back to the mean, there’s one thing I’m sure of. We
            will
            get what we want, and we will fucking hate it.</p>
