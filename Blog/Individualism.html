        <p>The church had one thing going for it. It unified entire regions under one belief - think of the Roman
            Empire. For a long time, the church and the state were one and the same. Actually, the state was the
            church.
            The church set the rules by which society lived by. The word was the constitution. The Roman Catholic
            Church
            was the highest power in the land. Every ruler had to consult the Pope on any major decision. And every
            conquest was done in the name of the lord. The head of the British monarchy was the head of the state
            and
            the head of the Anglican church. And every prime minister had to consult the King/Queen when any major
            decision was to be made. But then came the philosophers who reasoned that men have the liberty to decide
            for
            themselves what rules they live by. And while it took a while, the idea of democracy began to take root.
            And
            over time, democracy took precedence over divine rule. <a
                href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/885/establishment-clause-separation-of-church-and-state#:~:text=The%20first%20clause%20in%20the,respecting%20an%20establishment%20of%20religion.%E2%80%9D">The
                church lost its grip on the
                state.</a>
        </p>

        <p>Today, the state, while adopting aspects of the church - think leaders holding the Bible while being
            sworn
            in and witnesses holding the Bible before testifying - is separate from the church. And there is a
            general
            desire to keep the two separate. Maybe its because of the dirty nature of politics, or the dividing
            nature
            of politics. But the church is kept separate, only popping its head up from time to time on matters
            affecting the state. It is slowly losing people, as more and more people over time air as a
            <a href="https://colinmathers.com/2020/09/30/global-trends-in-religiosity-and-atheism-1980-to-2020/">non-practicing
                Christians, agnostic or
                atheist</a>. We
            switched from being united in belief, to now being united by arbitrary regional boundaries. We took the
            power from the church, and gave it to the state.
        </p>

        <h4>The State</h4>

        <p>States have been the major powers for at least two hundred years now. And in that time certain states
            have
            done really well for themselves, lifting their people out of poverty faster than any other time in
            history.
            And even with both World Wars included, the last two hundred years have been a lot more peaceful than
            any
            other time in history - I know, hard to believe. But it is during this time that international travel
            took
            root. We developed larger ships, meaning we could travel further and carry more materials. We developed
            the
            motor vehicles, allowing us to traverse land a lot faster than before. We developed airplanes which
            crossed
            water drastically faster than any ship could. And with the use of all these developments, we became an
            intra-planetary species, no longer locked to any specific locale.</p>

        <p>It is during this time that international trade developed. Trade led to capitalism, and capitalism
            led to
            wealth and power. The balance of power shifted from the state to individuals with resources. State
            leaders
            began <a
                href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjW_em71_L-AhVxXaQEHS-3Bo4QFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crf-usa.org%2Fimages%2Fpdf%2Fjpmorgan.pdf&usg=AOvVaw078uvk7xnPV5NDLUvlCwlA">turning
                to the wealthy for
                influence</a>,
            leading to highly biased decision making on the part of the state. The world wars led to the creation of
            international bodies that regulated the behavior of the member states. Then came the international
            financing
            bodies that determined the parameters within which each state <a
                href="https://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2019/06/what-are-the-main-criticisms-of-the-world-bank-and-the-imf/">conducted
                itself to get
                funded</a>.
            International trade became necessary. Borders became soft. If you had a piece of paper and the necessary
            resources, you could move anywhere with relative ease. All these factors led a drastic decline in powers
            of
            the state. People have become more and more disillusioned with the ability of the state to create
            positive
            change. It is reflected in the development of the free market economics, which argued that the state
            should
            leave the markets to self-regulate.</p>

        <h4>Society</h4>

        <p>But even as both the above structures lost dominance, one structure remained relatively strong.
            Society.
            Cluster within which people existed in unity with each other. These societies came up as a result of a
            variety of things. They could be based on tribe. On trade. On a natural resource like water. A shared
            belief. It could be anything, but these clusters of people were everywhere, and formed the basis upon
            which
            the church and the state gained power and prominence. It was said that a child wasn’t raised by a
            parent,
            but by a society. Values were decided on the societal level, and everyone lived by those values. A lot
            of
            resources were communal, and as a result, people knew each other. People would go far to trade, but
            still
            come back to the community they called home. The easiest way for the state to gain control <a
                href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163291/afghanistan-war-founded-lies-people-still-telling-them">was
                to
                influence
                the individual
                societies</a>
            that existed within its arbitrary boundaries. And so it would enlist people to go to fight wars, but it
            was
            done to protect the place they called home. And at the end of it all, they came home. And then society
            fell.</p>

        <p>Today, touch your neighbor’s and you’ll probably get shouted at at best, and sued at worst. That’s
            because
            we don’t recognize society anymore. We have individual liberties. Personal properties. And with the ease
            of
            travel these days, and the growing importance of individual wealth, we are able to move to other areas
            with
            ease. Areas where everyone else is there for the same reason you are. To create individual wealth. The
            poor
            up and leave the places they have called home as soon as they can, probably never to go back but as
            tourists. The middle class, as soon as they can, build their own houses and wall themselves off with
            either
            thick fences or high walls with shards of glass at the top or electric wires. They have to protect their
            property somehow. And the rich build houses in the middle of nowhere, where they can maintain their
            exclusive status. People don’t know their neighbors anymore. We are integrated across cultures more than
            ever before. But we couldn’t be more isolated.</p>

        <h4>Family</h4>

        <p>But again, one structure has stood the test of time - at least until now. The family has been the
            center of
            all the above structures. None of the above structures could stand on their own without the family. And
            the
            family has been relatively stable and same for all of history. The number of fathers and/or mothers
            might
            have varied from place to place, according to the individual customs. But these basics stayed the same.
            A
            father. A mother. And children. A self repeating cycle that has existed for thousands of years. And when
            all
            else failed, people could always turn back to the family structure for protection and safety. But in the
            last 60 years, the family, the last remaining stronghold of co-existence, is crumbling. Women are now
            part
            of the workforce. They are now more capable of providing. Men, for the most part, seem not to be aware
            of
            this. And its creating a power struggle that will end with the collapse of the family structure.</p>

        <p><a
                href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/05/29/chapter-2-public-views-on-changing-gender-roles/">Gender
                roles are changing
                drastically</a>.
            Women are coming back home at the same time the men are. And so a debate arises. Who ‘raises’ the
            children?
            Who cooks the meals? Who pays for school fees? Who pays for the date? Who takes the kid to school? Who
            goes
            for the kid’s visiting day? Both men and women expect the other to occupy the traditional role. But that
            isn’t viable today. The man isn’t the sole breadwinner anymore, as the woman today can and should chip
            in.
            And the woman isn’t just the caretaker anymore, as she is now capable of much more. But we haven’t yet
            adopted to the new paradigm, and that’s creating a whole swath of issues. Divorces are on the rise.
            There’s
            an epidemic of single parent households. And the data of single parent households shows that it is a net
            negative for society.</p>

        <h4>Individual Liberty</h4>

        <p>So what happens when the last unifying structure collapses? When the one structure that provided the
            basis
            for identity is no more? We are left with individual liberty. Individual rights. A person decides who
            they
            are. No one decides for him/her. And that has its consequences. We are left with <a
                href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/gender-fluidity-what-it-means-and-why-support-matters-2020120321544#:~:text=Gender%20fluidity%20refers%20to%20change,and%20identity%20might%20change%20together">gender
                fluidity</a>.
            Where a child can decide that they are a man or a woman, disregarding completely the biological
            foundations.
            We are left with <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/what-does-sexually-fluid-mean">sexual
                fluidity</a>,
            where anyone can sleep with anyone, whether male or female. We are left with a group of people who are
            unable to form any long lasting relationships. Because where would they learn that? What example has
            been
            set for them? This compounded by the fact that there is a lot <a
                href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/12/abundance-of-choice-and-its-effect-on-decision-making.php">more
                variety and
                choice</a>
            than there has ever existed before, making choice decisions harder.</p>

        <p>I mention these consequences as a statement of fact. I do not take any moral high ground. The debate
            of
            whether these changes are a net positive or net negative will rage on forever. But the fact is that
            these
            changes are occurring, and honestly, there is no going back. It is the world we live in. Progress is
            agnostic. It doesn’t care about your individual views. It is always marching forward. But god do I worry
            about our kids. That, from my generation’s perspective, is going to be one fucked up generation.</p>
