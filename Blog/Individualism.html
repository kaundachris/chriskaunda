            <p>The church had one thing going for it. It unified entire regions under one belief - think of the Roman
                Empire. For a long time, the church and the state were one and the same. Actually, the state was the
                church.
                The church set the rules by which society lived by. The word was the constitution. The Roman Catholic
                Church
                was the highest power in the land. Every ruler had to consult the Pope on any major decision. And every
                conquest was done in the name of the lord. The head of the British monarchy was the head of the state
                and
                the head of the Anglican church. And every prime minister had to consult the King/Queen when any major
                decision was to be made. But then came the philosophers who reasoned that men have the liberty to decide
                for
                themselves what rules they live by. And while it took a while, the idea of democracy began to take root.
                And
                over time, democracy took precedence over divine rule. <a

            </p>

            <p>Today, the state, while adopting aspects of the church - think leaders holding the Bible while being
                sworn
                in and witnesses holding the Bible before testifying - is separate from the church. And there is a
                general
                desire to keep the two separate. Maybe its because of the dirty nature of politics, or the dividing
                nature
                of politics. But the church is kept separate, only popping its head up from time to time on matters
                affecting the state. It is slowly losing people, as more and more people over time air as a

                power from the church, and gave it to the state.
            </p>

            <h4>The State</h4>

            <p>States have been the major powers for at least two hundred years now. And in that time certain states
                have
                done really well for themselves, lifting their people out of poverty faster than any other time in
                history.
                And even with both World Wars included, the last two hundred years have been a lot more peaceful than
                any
                other time in history - I know, hard to believe. But it is during this time that international travel
                took
                root. We developed larger ships, meaning we could travel further and carry more materials. We developed
                the
                motor vehicles, allowing us to traverse land a lot faster than before. We developed airplanes which
                crossed
                water drastically faster than any ship could. And with the use of all these developments, we became an
                intra-planetary species, no longer locked to any specific locale.</p>

            <p>It is during this time that international trade developed. Trade led to capitalism, and capitalism
                led to
                wealth and power. The balance of power shifted from the state to individuals with resources. State
                leaders
                began <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjW_em71_L-AhVxXaQEHS-3Bo4QFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crf-usa.org%2Fimages%2Fpdf%2Fjpmorgan.pdf&usg=AOvVaw078uvk7xnPV5NDLUvlCwlA"
                    target="_blank">turning
                    to the wealthy for
                    influence</a>,
                leading to highly biased decision making on the part of the state. The world wars led to the creation of
                international bodies that regulated the behavior of the member states. Then came the international
                financing
                bodies that determined the parameters within which each state <a
                    href="https://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/2019/06/what-are-the-main-criticisms-of-the-world-bank-and-the-imf/"
                    target="_blank">conducted
                    itself to get
                    funded</a>.
                International trade became necessary. Borders became soft. If you had a piece of paper and the necessary
                resources, you could move anywhere with relative ease. All these factors led a drastic decline in powers
                of
                the state. People have become more and more disillusioned with the ability of the state to create
                positive
                change. It is reflected in the development of the free market economics, which argued that the state
                should
                leave the markets to self-regulate.</p>

            <h4>Society</h4>

            <p>But even as both the above structures lost dominance, one structure remained relatively strong.
                Society.
                Cluster within which people existed in unity with each other. These societies came up as a result of a
                variety of things. They could be based on tribe. On trade. On a natural resource like water. A shared
                belief. It could be anything, but these clusters of people were everywhere, and formed the basis upon
                which
                the church and the state gained power and prominence. It was said that a child wasn’t raised by a
                parent,
                but by a society. Values were decided on the societal level, and everyone lived by those values. A lot
                of
                resources were communal, and as a result, people knew each other. People would go far to trade, but
                still
                come back to the community they called home. The easiest way for the state to gain control <a
                    href="https://newrepublic.com/article/163291/afghanistan-war-founded-lies-people-still-telling-them"
                    target="_blank">was
                    to
                    influence
                    the individual
                    societies</a>
                that existed within its arbitrary boundaries. And so it would enlist people to go to fight wars, but it
                was
                done to protect the place they called home. And at the end of it all, they came home. And then society
                fell.</p>

            <p>Today, touch your neighbor’s and you’ll probably get shouted at at best, and sued at worst. That’s
                because
                we don’t recognize society anymore. We have individual liberties. Personal properties. And with the ease
                of
                travel these days, and the growing importance of individual wealth, we are able to move to other areas
                with
                ease. Areas where everyone else is there for the same reason you are. To create individual wealth. The
                poor
                up and leave the places they have called home as soon as they can, probably never to go back but as
                tourists. The middle class, as soon as they can, build their own houses and wall themselves off with
                either
                thick fences or high walls with shards of glass at the top or electric wires. They have to protect their
                property somehow. And the rich build houses in the middle of nowhere, where they can maintain their
                exclusive status. People don’t know their neighbors anymore. We are integrated across cultures more than
                ever before. But we couldn’t be more isolated.</p>

            <h4>Family</h4>

            <p>But again, one structure has stood the test of time - at least until now. The family has been the
                center of
                all the above structures. None of the above structures could stand on their own without the family. And
                the
                family has been relatively stable and same for all of history. The number of fathers and/or mothers
                might
                have varied from place to place, according to the individual customs. But these basics stayed the same.
                A
                father. A mother. And children. A self repeating cycle that has existed for thousands of years. And when
                all
                else failed, people could always turn back to the family structure for protection and safety. But in the
                last 60 years, the family, the last remaining stronghold of co-existence, is crumbling. Women are now
                part
                of the workforce. They are now more capable of providing. Men, for the most part, seem not to be aware
                of
                this. And its creating a power struggle that will end with the collapse of the family structure.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/05/29/chapter-2-public-views-on-changing-gender-roles/"
                    target="_blank">Gender
                    roles are changing
                    drastically</a>.
                Women are coming back home at the same time the men are. And so a debate arises. Who ‘raises’ the
                children?
                Who cooks the meals? Who pays for school fees? Who pays for the date? Who takes the kid to school? Who
                goes
                for the kid’s visiting day? Both men and women expect the other to occupy the traditional role. But that
                isn’t viable today. The man isn’t the sole breadwinner anymore, as the woman today can and should chip
                in.
                And the woman isn’t just the caretaker anymore, as she is now capable of much more. But we haven’t yet
                adopted to the new paradigm, and that’s creating a whole swath of issues. Divorces are on the rise.
                There’s
                an epidemic of single parent households. And the data of single parent households shows that it is a net
                negative for society.</p>

            <h4>Individual Liberty</h4>

            <p>So what happens when the last unifying structure collapses? When the one structure that provided the
                basis
                for identity is no more? We are left with individual liberty. Individual rights. A person decides who
                they
                are. No one decides for him/her. And that has its consequences. We are left with <a
                    href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/gender-fluidity-what-it-means-and-why-support-matters-2020120321544#:~:text=Gender%20fluidity%20refers%20to%20change,and%20identity%20might%20change%20together"
                    target="_blank">gender
                    fluidity</a>.
                Where a child can decide that they are a man or a woman, disregarding completely the biological
                foundations.
                We are left with <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/what-does-sexually-fluid-mean"
                    target="_blank">sexual
                    fluidity</a>,
                where anyone can sleep with anyone, whether male or female. We are left with a group of people who are
                unable to form any long lasting relationships. Because where would they learn that? What example has
                been
                set for them? This compounded by the fact that there is a lot <a
                    href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/12/abundance-of-choice-and-its-effect-on-decision-making.php"
                    target="_blank">more
                    variety and
                    choice</a>
                than there has ever existed before, making choice decisions harder.</p>

            <p>I mention these consequences as a statement of fact. I do not take any moral high ground. The debate
                of
                whether these changes are a net positive or net negative will rage on forever. But the fact is that
                these
                changes are occurring, and honestly, there is no going back. It is the world we live in. Progress is
                agnostic. It doesn’t care about your individual views. It is always marching forward. But god do I worry
                about our kids. That, from my generation’s perspective, is going to be one fucked up generation.</p>
