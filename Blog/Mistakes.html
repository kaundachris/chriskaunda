        <p>This blog is meant to be a sort of guide to anyone starting out investing. The stock market is a minefield,
            and I’d like to help out someone, anyone thinking of doing this. Its easy to lose money, and its easy to
            make
            catastrophic mistakes that lock losses for long periods of time. I try to weave this lessons with personal
            anecdotes and stories. Hopefully it doesn’t seem too self absorbing. If it does, well write something in the
            contact forms below. I’ll make whatever changes are necessary.</p>

        <p>And now, for the lessons:</p>

        <h4>Concentration Is Not Your Friend</h4>

        <p>At the start, I put almost 90% of my money into technology companies. Being raised during the early through
            late
            stages of the internet, some of the companies I’m most familiar with are tech companies. But one thing
            you’ll
            realize is that tech companies, due to their high correlation with each other, pull each other up and down.
            If
            Facebook comes out with some bad news, its going to pull Tik Tok, Twitter, and Snapchat down, as they are
            all
            social media companies. Its going to pull Google and Amazon down, as they all get majority of their revenue
            from
            advertising. You get the point. It might be awesome when the news is all rosy. Its when shit gets bad when
            you’ll thank yourself for putting some cash into a boring old industrial company that holds up no matter
            what.</p>

        <p>Since then, I’ve put a large portion of my portfolio - about 40% - into index funds. This includes <a
                href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/best-total-stock-market-index-funds/">total
                stock
                market funds</a> and other ETFs.
            This ensures that a portion of my portfolio is relatively diversified, and therefore safe. I’ve also
            diversified
            my individual stock portfolio to cover up for my mistake, putting money into industrial companies, food
            manufacturers and real estate investment trusts. I’m still highly concentrated in tech - by my standards -
            but
            its at a point I’m comfortable with. If you’re not willing to put in the work, buy a broad market index
            fund.
            It’ll save you a lot of headaches.</p>

        <h4>Slow and Steady.</h4>

        <p>I made the mistake of dumping a huge amounts of cash into the market. This is compounded by the fact that I
            entered the market as it was beginning to go down. This meant that a large number of the stocks went down,
            and
            took that initial amount down with them. As an example, a 10% downward move on an initial $1,000 is still
            larger
            than a 90% upward move on $100. This is especially true when you are in a bear market, where its just a
            stream
            of negative news. This has actually been one of my biggest headaches, as it has taken much longer than I
            would
            have wanted to reach breakeven, even with subsequent investments.</p>

        <p>So what’s the advice here? <a href="https://intelligent.schwab.com/article/dollar-cost-averaging">Dollar Cost
                Average</a>.
            You’ll hear this quite a lot from me. But its with reason. This is probably the best strategy for a number
            of
            reasons. One, its a lot easier to plan for. You just select a specific amount which you are comfortable
            investing every month - heck, every week - and invest that. Second is that this is consistently the strategy
            that yields the best results, as it allows you to build substantial positions during downturns, and enjoy
            the
            ride during upturns. Three, and most importantly, it ensures that you don’t make costly mistakes with large
            amounts of cash at any point in time. Remember the first rule of the stock market: Don’t lose money - in
            this
            case too much money.</p>

        <h4>hey make money off of you</h4>

        <p>One of the silliest mistakes when I started out was not considering the costs involved in investing. Let me
            make
            this clear. Banks are not your friends. They make money off of you. The conversion rates they offer here
            border
            on the insane. The spreads they enjoy, fucking hell! When I made my first investment, I used the bank to
            transfer the money, and ended up paying more than 5% if the investment in the conversion and transfer costs.
            That is just insane, as that means that I have to make 5% on my initial investment to just cover up for this
            cost. One of the first platforms I used charged 2.3% upfront to just take my money. You quickly see how you
            can
            already be in the negative when you make your first investment.</p>

        <p>If you can find a safe alternative to your bank and your card partner. Use it. Key word here being safe.
            Don’t
            be stupid about it. I currently use use <a href="https://wise.com/invite/u/kaundac">Wise (formerly
                TransferWise)</a> to dollar cost average into the markets.
            There’s still some cost to it, but its significantly lower than what the banks offer. And besides, I’m in
            this
            for the long haul, so the costs aren’t too big in the grand scheme of things. Also read the fine print for
            whatever broker you end up using. You don’t want your profits to be eaten up by transaction costs every time
            you
            buy. <a href="https://ibkr.com/referral/christopher5060">Interactive Brokers</a> charges some of the lowest
            rates in
            the
            market. This is beneficial to me since I buy fractional shares.</p>

        <h4>Do Your Own Research</h4>

        <p>There are some companies I bought whose valuations sometimes make me sick. Knowing what I know now, I would
            have
            kept far away from those stock, no matter how promising they are. One of the basic measures of valuations
            ifs
            the PE Ratio. This is simply a measure of how many years it would take the company to pay you back your
            investment into it. So you can imagine what a PE Ratio of 100 means. I’ve discovered that I really don’t
            like
            risk, and are more inclined to value investing - not that this doesn’t have its own risk. That means PE
            Ratios
            past a certain threshold are just too expensive for me. I haven’t yet sold these stocks. I have an average
            hold
            period of 3 years. But whenever I’m assessing my portfolio, they do make me a little bit nervous.</p>

        <p>My suggestion on this is to determine what kind of risk you are comfortable taking. That means looking at
            your
            own habits and predispositions. You can invest in broad market index funds at first, as you learn more about
            yourself and what you are into. This ensure you have a safe basket that can swallow up any mistakes you
            make.
            Try and keep away from the hype, as it might lead you to make some rash decisions. Remember, the stock
            market is
            fundamentally <a
                href="https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stories/34983/the-relationship-between-psychology-and-stock-investing">a
                game of
                psychology</a>.
            So master your own psychology first, then get good at everyone else’s.</p>

        <p>I’ve included links to some of the terms that you need to read up more on. Please make sure you do. One thing
            you’ll discover about active investing - trading individual stocks - is that it requires a whole lot of
            reading
            and observation. So if you are not up to it, stick to index funds. Otherwise, best of luck. Take care!</p>
