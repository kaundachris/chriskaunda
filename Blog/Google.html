            <p>Of all the companies I’ve come across in the last year of investing, Google has probably the cleanest and
                best-looking balance sheet of them all. Now I know balance sheets don’t offer much excitement to many
                people,
                but for anybody looking to get into the world of investing, this is just one of the three items you
                should
                always pay close attention to. Two articles ago, I offered up part of the criteria that I use to decide
                the
                companies I invest in. While Google doesn’t fit perfectly into my personal criteria, it was a company I
                was
                interested in (due to its pervasiveness in culture). And boy was I glad I broke one of my rules. Below,
                I’ll
                go
                through some of the highlights of the company, and what make it a company to add to your watchlist.</p>

            <h4>Huge Cash Balance</h4>

            <p>The company has a cash balance (including equivalents) of over $130 Billion. Read that line again.
                Sometimes
                I
                wonder how any company can have such a cash balance, and where such cash could be kept. Because that’s
                an
                absurd
                amount of money to have lying around. But that’s what Google has. That’s their armory. To put some
                perspective,
                Google has enough cash to straight up buy
                <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=amd+market+cap&oq=amdmarke&aqs=edge.1.69i57j0i10i512l8.4376j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"
                    target="_blank">AMD</a>
                or
                <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=netflix+market+cap&ei=6OlwY5-ZCKPB8gKGyqOgDg&ved=0ahUKEwifrYnpmqv7AhWjoFwKHQblCOQQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=netflix+market+cap&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgcIABCABBANMgcIABCABBANMgYIABAeEA1KBAhNGAFKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQAFjLC2DKDGgAcAF4AIAB8AKIAdwPkgEDMy02mAEAoAEBwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp"
                    target="_blank">Netflix</a>
                or
                <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+market+cap&ei=8ulwY47iJoG68gK63KPADA&ved=0ahUKEwiOo4rumqv7AhUBnVwKHTruCMgQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=intel+market+cap&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIECAAQQzIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIGCAAQBxAeMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHkoECE0YAUoECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWPQGYLkOaABwAXgAgAHGA4gB4w2SAQUzLTQuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp"
                    target="_blank">Intel</a>.
                For cash. Without debt. This kind of balance helps to ensure that the company can basically carry out
                any
                research and development needed. It can create new products and scrap them all-together without as much
                as a
                flinch. It helps explain why Google has never been afraid to kill off projects that didn’t perform to
                standard.
                There’s an entire website dedicated to <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/" target="_blank">projects
                    Google
                    has killed
                    off</a>, with
                over
                two hundred projects last I checked. There a laundry list of them: Hangouts, Play Music, Stadia, Play
                Movies,
                etc.. And that’s a good thing. Their war-chest allows the company to try things, quickly innovate, and
                cut
                whatever isn’t working.
            </p>

            <p>There have been a number of wonderful projects and applications that have come out of this. The most
                significant
                is obviously YouTube. The platform had to exist for a long time as a cost inefficient experiment. But
                Google
                has
                been able to scale it to a point where I’d argue that its as big as Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video
                put
                together. Where else do people go to a near daily basis today for everything from news to entertainment?
                And
                where else do advertisers have the same amount of attention as they do on YouTube. Its what is allowing
                the
                company to carry out the massive research needed to make Waymo, an industry leader in a quickly
                saturating
                market. I’m of the firm belief that Google, with its continued investments, can over time become the
                Berkshire
                of the previous generation. Only time will tell.</p>

            <h4>High Operating Margin</h4>

            <p>Software companies have one major advantage over every other type of company out there. Once they develop
                software, they can sell it over and over again for relatively little additional cost. This is what
                allows
                software companies to be as efficient as they are today. They need comparatively low manpower to
                operate.
                Google
                is one of the best companies at this. With an <a
                    href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingmargin.asp" target="_blank">operating
                    margin</a> of over 30%, the company is pretty
                efficient
                at generating value for its shareholders (for every $1 the company earns, it keeps $0.3 for itself).
                This is
                in
                comparison to hardware heavy companies such as industrials that operate at 5% margin or so. Industrial
                companies
                that need massive investments in expensive equipment, factories and widespread operations, to expand
                just a
                smidge. Google, on the other hand, mostly only needs to ensure that it has enough servers to handle its
                operations. Manpower needs are relatively limited, as most software is written to run by itself. The
                company
                can
                therefore ramp up or drive down its operations swiftly.</p>

            <h4>Liquidity Ratios</h4>

            <p>Google’s Current and Quick Ratios hover around 3:1. This means that for every dollar in short term
                liabilities
                Google has, it has 3 in short term assets. The implication here goes back to the cashflow of the
                company.
                Google
                doesn’t have to worry about any short term obligations coming through, and them not being able to meet
                those
                obligation. It has three times the amount in short term assets that it can quickly redeem. Chief among
                them
                being its massive cash reserves. The risk of liquidation for Google is close to zero. Not non-existent,
                but
                pretty low. Its low debt position also means that it doesn’t have to commit large amount for cash to
                debt
                repayment. It can commit most of its money towards its actual business operations. This, again, ties in
                to
                the
                company’s cash balances.</p>

            <h4>Cashflows</h4>

            <p>The main advantage of Google’s highly efficient operations is that it generates huge cashflows for the
                company.
                See, cashflow - I think - is more important for a company’s survival than the amounts of profit it
                makes.
                Cashflow allows the company to keep running. It pays for its inventory, its employees, its electricity
                bill,
                its
                research and development. And Google generated over $50 Billion in cashflow in 2021. This feeds in to
                its
                massive cash balance discussed above. All that excess can be used in a number of different ways -
                advertising,
                acquisitions etc. - outside of those already discussed. And that’s on top of the company growing
                cashflow at
                a
                rate of over 30% over the last three years. Google as a company, is getting more and more efficient.</p>

            <h4>And so…</h4>

            <p>All these factors combined create a scenario that gives Google a sense of imperviousness. Its products
                are
                used
                on a daily basis, by <a
                    href="https://wpdevshed.com/how-many-people-use-google/#:~:text=Google%20has%20shown%20a%20phenomenal,Google%20in%20their%20daily%20lives"
                    target="_blank">over
                    two billion
                    people</a>
                all over the world. It collects massive amounts of data that it can use to continuously evolve its
                products.
                Its
                business is relatively lean, especially for such a big company. It is generating huge cashflows from its
                operations. And its foundation - balance sheet- is as solid as can be. The only threat at this moment
                seems
                to
                be Google itself. Very few companies have become synonymous to our daily life. One of those companies is
                Google.
                The vast majority of the world interacts with at least one Google product on a daily basis. That could
                be
                googling something on the internet, looking for a video on YouTube, checking your email, using a
                smartphone,
                looking at your photos. You’ll come across a Google product. And that’s on the consumer side. The
                enterprise
                side - in terms of advertising - can’t market without using Google Ads and YouTube Ads (think of the
                relentless
                Glovo ads on YouTube). Companies can’t cooperate without using GSuite in one way or another. And Google
                Cloud is
                only growing. Google is a part of our daily life. We use it without even thinking about it. Its name is
                literally a verb now. That’s not to mention the community it has built around YouTube. With such power,
                can
                it be trusted to always operate in the best interests of tis stakeholders? Can it live up to its motto -
                Don’t
                Be Evil?</p>
