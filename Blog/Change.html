        <p>Here’s a funny thing we sometimes forget. <a
                href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kenya-declares-independence-from-britain"
                target="_blank">We got
                independence in
                1964</a>. That’s just 60
            years ago. Meaning there’s only one generation separating my cohort from colonization. It seems far away,
            but
            some of our parents remember what it was like to live under the rule of the colonialists. All of our
            grandparents remember it. They don’t talk about it, but they do remember it. My granduncle talked to me
            about
            going to war for the white man. How they had to carry heavy bags everywhere they went. How those heavy bags
            compressed parts of their bodies. How carrying those heavy bags for prolonged periods caused nerve damage.
            Nerve
            damage that made his life significantly harder later in life. And just in case this seems far, <a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/apartheid" target="_blank">segregation in
                South Africa</a> ended as we were being born. There is no generation
            separating South Africans my age from the colonialists. Their parents experienced it. Fought it. Their
            parents
            remember victory. They have a good picture of life before and life after.</p>

        <p>For a long, long time, this was the norm. And the funny thing is, just as there are people on our side who
            remember subjugation, there are people on their side who do too. And given that this was the natural order
            for a
            long time, these people still live by those standards. We call them neocolonialists today. People who still
            subscribe to the old order. These are people who never accepted that the world was changing. People who
            think
            we're poor, and need help. There are some from our generation. Most are from the generation that remembers.
        </p>

        <h4>Racism</h4>

        <p>Here’s something that’s a bit jarring. <a
                href="https://www.history.com/news/african-american-voting-right-15th-amendment"
                target="_blank">Segregation in schools
                and public
                places</a> in the United States of
            America - the paragon of modern culture - only got fully abolished in the 1960’s. Like colonialism for us,
            that’s just 60 years back. Meaning there’s a whole generation of Black Americans that were brought up in a
            world
            that considered white people a separate breed. They remember not being able to sit with white people. They
            remember having to use different toilets from white people. Having to go through an education system
            completely
            separate and different from that of the white man. And their children still remember being treated as lesser
            than. Because even if segregation had ended, it was still fresh in our minds. It was now a soft rule, rather
            than a hard one codified in law. What we call racism now, was for a long, long, time, the norm. And Black
            Americans had to fight very hard to get their voices heard. To create change, no matter how small. The
            struggle,
            by that point had been going on for two hundred years. Small changes here and there that culminated with the
            civil rights movement in the 1960’s.</p>

        <p>But there were still people, on the other side, who didn’t accept this change, whether full or partially.
            There
            are people who still consider themselves superior. And there are some, who just by existing during that
            period,
            got conditioned to see us a certain way. You can’t really blame them. We call these people racists today.
            There
            are some who are from our generation. But most are from the generation that remembers.</p>

        <h4>Misogyny</h4>

        <p>Here’s something that we don’t really think about - at least men don’t that much. Women only got generally
            accepted in the workforce something like 30 - 40 years ago. Before women were only to do certain jobs that
            were
            for them. Secretaries, nurses, seamstresses, and such. Most other white and blue collar jobs were for men.
            Women
            were to stay home and raise children. Tend to the home. Men went out to earn a living for their families.
            These
            were the roles set by society. And everyone played by the rules. And while there were some - think <a
                href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1903/marie-curie/biographical/" target="_blank">Marie
                Curie</a> - who broke from this norm a
            lot earlier, it was generally accepted that this was the way of life. Even for something as trivial as
            pants,
            the change is relatively recent. There were churches where you’d be thrown out of if you went wearing pants,
            leave alone the tight ones that are the norm today. Pants were for men. Dresses were for women.</p>

        <p>Traditional roles, and all the quirks that come with them, are what we call misogyny today. The rules of the
            old
            world are what we partly call - or attribute as - the patriarchy. And unlike colonialism and racism, which
            happened long ago enough for us not to remember or be part of, this is something we are actively or
            passively
            participating in. This is a change that is happening in the world we occupy today. And for this, the people
            who
            never accepted are still part of the ether. We don’t hear stories from the past. We see it in the present.
            Happening to our mothers, our sisters. There are many among us who haven’t accepted that that old world is
            dying. There are still many among us who consider women weak. Who think women can’t lead, despite of the
            increasing evidence to the contrary - think Angela Merkel, Jacinda Ardern. And unlike colonialism and racism
            to
            an extent, for misogyny, we will be the generation that remembers.</p>

        <h4>Barabbas</h4>

        <p>‘Crucify him,’ they all cried. <a href="https://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/barabbas" target="_blank">Give
                us
                Barabbas</a>. That’s what
            the crowd demanded. The choice was between a man whose sins were known - who the bible described as a
            notorious
            criminal - and a man who has just said some stuff. And the people chose the criminal. Maybe because they
            understood his sins. Maybe because the sins of the man were known to them. Were familiar to them. Maybe
            because
            they had, at some point, committed those same sins. Or at least had thought about it. Maybe because the sins
            of
            Barabbas were common place. They were usual. They were part of the system. On the other hand, the sins of
            this
            other guy, in the crowd’s mind, we’re highly unusual, and created a sort of cognitive dissonance. Whatever
            the
            reasons were, we know the crowd chose to spare a criminal, and crucify a man who didn’t do anything
            particularly
            unlawful. That’s the effect something contrary to the norm has on people. They get hostile. They get
            moralistic.
            We’d rather deal with a sin we know than one than we don’t.</p>

        <p>What’s my point with all this exactly? It is that change is inevitable. It is part of the human condition. It
            is
            how we as humans progress. But all change faces very stiff resistance. Because it fucks up what people have
            become accustomed to. What they call normal life. There was a lot of struggle when it comes to our
            liberation
            from the colonialists. There was a lot of struggle when it comes to blacks fighting for their civil rights.
            And
            there is a lot of struggle for women to be respected and recognized. With these struggles, comes some level
            of
            cognitive dissonance for those who are used to their old lives. And its not exclusive to the oppressors. But
            progress is agnostic. It does not whether its for good or bad. It only knows one thing. Forward, never
            backwards.</p>
