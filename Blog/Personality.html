    <h1 class="centre">Personality</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p><em class="intro">In Kenya, as with everywhere else, looking for jobs is a job itself.</em></p>

        <p>In Kenya, looking for jobs is a job itself. It can be incredibly frustrating, as different companies have
            different procedures for making applications. It can take you upwards of 30 minutes to complete just one
            application. Applying for jobs, as with most things in life, is a statistical game. One application will not
            make it. It has to be several a week, continuously, until something sticks. That was and continues to be my
            strategy. But what happens after you get a call-back, an interview. We have applied so many jobs, and
            therefore
            have plenty of experience on this initial part of that process. The second part is a lot more niche, and
            this is
            where a lot of people stumble and fall. However, with the right tools, this can be the easiest part of your
            career development.</p>

        <h4>Your Papers</h4>

        <p>All other factors constant, your papers need only to be good enough to get you through the door. Past
            that, your
            personality will matter a whole lot more. This is the realization I've come to regarding the job market.
            This is
            not to take away from how frustrating looking for a job is. I know its not a pleasant experience. I've been
            there. However, how many times have you been in an interview, answered all the questions to the best of your
            ability, and still missed the position to someone seemingly less qualified that you? I'm guessing a couple
            of
            times. What made them the best choice? This is where personality comes in.</p>

        <h4>Charisma Wins</h4>

        <p>Employers are willing to take an average candidate with an exceptional personality over a good but bland
            candidate. The amount of charisma one oozes, the confidence in behavior and speech, and most importantly,
            the
            level of honesty one emanates - these will either raise or lower your chances at a position more than your
            papers ever will. But this is on the condition that you are already in the room. If not fix the initial step
            first. Make yourself more attractive on paper.</p>

        <p>Experience has also shown that a level of detachment from an opportunity allows you as a candidate to be a
            lot
            more relaxed going into the interview. Its a balance between arrogance and confidence - the admission that
            you
            might not get the position, and that this is okay. I know that for most people, an interview, and therefore
            a
            job, offers the chance at a lifechanging experience. However, thinking about this going into an interview
            will
            only serve to make you more nervous. Detachment allows you to a be a lot more natural, both in behavior and
            speech. Your aim should be to try and make the interview as conversational as you can, while remaining
            within
            the context of the situation. You can only achieve this if you are relaxed. Nervousness comes off more than
            we
            think, and it can be our enemy. Recruiters have a nose for nervousness. They will eat you alive if they
            sense
            it.</p>

        <h4>What Are Your Interests</h4>

        <p>Time, and how you make use of it is also an important factor. By this I do not mean activities related to
            studying. That's not very interesting. Participate in Entrepreneurship, art, activities and sports in your
            'in
            between jobs' periods. Employers are increasingly asking about this kind of stuff. It might seem trivial,
            but it
            matters a whole lot. Your use of free time speaks a lot about your efficiency, your work ethic, and your
            resourcefulness. No one wants to hire someone who's been idle for months, even years. Its not a good look.
            Do
            things you find interesting, and be willing to bring them up during interviews. It will make you a whole lot
            more interesting, and it has the chance of changing the interview into a conversation. This will only work
            in
            your favor.</p>

        <h4>Research the Company</h4>

        <p>Knowing the company background is also extremely important. It allows you to gear whatever answers you give
            towards the company's motives. Stop cramming specific answers. A company executive wants to see how much of
            a
            fit you'll be to the company and its objectives, and anything that hints at this is going to help a lot.
            Understand the company's values, culture, environment of operation, goals and issues. Read about the company
            from its website and its appearances elsewhere. Always try to gear your answers towards these aspects. It
            will
            show you understand the company, and we all crave understanding, don't we?</p>
