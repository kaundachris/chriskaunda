            <p>In Kenya, looking for jobs is a job itself. It can be incredibly frustrating, as different companies have
                different procedures for making applications. It can take you upwards of 30 minutes to complete just one
                application. Applying for jobs, as with most things in life, is a statistical game. One application will
                not
                make it. It has to be several a week, continuously, until something sticks. That was and continues to be
                my
                strategy. But what happens after you get a call-back, an interview. We have applied so many jobs, and
                therefore
                have plenty of experience on this initial part of that process. The second part is a lot more niche, and
                this is
                where a lot of people stumble and fall. However, with the right tools, this can be the easiest part of
                your
                career development.</p>

            <h4>Your Papers</h4>

            <p>All other factors constant, your papers need only to be good enough to get you through the door. Past
                that, your
                personality will matter a whole lot more. This is the realization I've come to regarding the job market.
                This is
                not to take away from how frustrating looking for a job is. I know its not a pleasant experience. I've
                been
                there. However, how many times have you been in an interview, answered all the questions to the best of
                your
                ability, and still missed the position to someone seemingly less qualified that you? I'm guessing a
                couple
                of
                times. What made them the best choice? This is where personality comes in.</p>

            <h4>Charisma Wins</h4>

            <p>Employers are willing to take an average candidate with an exceptional personality over a good but bland
                candidate. The amount of charisma one oozes, the confidence in behavior and speech, and most
                importantly,
                the
                level of honesty one emanates - these will either raise or lower your chances at a position more than
                your
                papers ever will. But this is on the condition that you are already in the room. If not fix the initial
                step
                first. Make yourself more attractive on paper.</p>

            <p>Experience has also shown that a level of detachment from an opportunity allows you as a candidate to be
                a
                lot
                more relaxed going into the interview. Its a balance between arrogance and confidence - the admission
                that
                you
                might not get the position, and that this is okay. I know that for most people, an interview, and
                therefore
                a
                job, offers the chance at a lifechanging experience. However, thinking about this going into an
                interview
                will
                only serve to make you more nervous. Detachment allows you to a be a lot more natural, both in behavior
                and
                speech. Your aim should be to try and make the interview as conversational as you can, while remaining
                within
                the context of the situation. You can only achieve this if you are relaxed. Nervousness comes off more
                than
                we
                think, and it can be our enemy. Recruiters have a nose for nervousness. They will eat you alive if they
                sense
                it.</p>

            <h4>What Are Your Interests</h4>

            <p>Time, and how you make use of it is also an important factor. By this I do not mean activities related to
                studying. That's not very interesting. Participate in Entrepreneurship, art, activities and sports in
                your
                'in
                between jobs' periods. Employers are increasingly asking about this kind of stuff. It might seem
                trivial,
                but it
                matters a whole lot. Your use of free time speaks a lot about your efficiency, your work ethic, and your
                resourcefulness. No one wants to hire someone who's been idle for months, even years. Its not a good
                look.
                Do
                things you find interesting, and be willing to bring them up during interviews. It will make you a whole
                lot
                more interesting, and it has the chance of changing the interview into a conversation. This will only
                work
                in
                your favor.</p>

            <h4>Research the Company</h4>

            <p>Knowing the company background is also extremely important. It allows you to gear whatever answers you
                give
                towards the company's motives. Stop cramming specific answers. A company executive wants to see how much
                of
                a
                fit you'll be to the company and its objectives, and anything that hints at this is going to help a lot.
                Understand the company's values, culture, environment of operation, goals and issues. Read about the
                company
                from its website and its appearances elsewhere. Always try to gear your answers towards these aspects.
                It
                will
                show you understand the company, and we all crave understanding, don't we?</p>
