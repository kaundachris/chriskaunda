        <p>The man’s trouble was that he was not able to imagine. As he looked back at the trail, which revealed to him
            nothing but grey clouds and a white earth, he felt nothing. No worry. It was cold and uncomfortable. Nothing
            more than that. He failed to consider the gravity of the situation he was in. He failed to consider that man
            can
            only exist within a thin boundary of hot and cold. He failed to consider that even a brief exposure to the
            cold,
            either by accident or intentionally, would cause considerable discomfort at best, and death at worst. In the
            words of Jacob Geller, a monster might kill you, but the cold will.</p>

        <p>Long Term Capital Management (LTCM from now on) was a hedge fund that was created by the best of the best.
            Among
            its partners were two Nobel Prize winners in Economics, and the pioneers in a field called options trading,
            a
            field the firm was highly involved in. Others included the group of people who had set up and grown the bond
            arbitrage branch at Salomon Brothers. As such, what they had, more than anything else, was credibility.
            These
            were the smartest people on wallstreet. And they were starting a hedge fund. People wanted in, and the firm
            raised somewhere in the region of $1 billion - this without the investors seeing what the fund was going to
            do
            with their money. The fund was set up in 1994. It had three extremely good years where it basically
            quadrupled
            it’s investor’s money, a return that is almost mythical. And then, in it’s fourth year, it collapsed, and
            had to
            be bailed out.</p>

        <h4>Be Careful With Debt My Friends</h4>

        <p>Leverage - or debt - is a tool that can create miracles. Leverage can quite simply create something out of
            nothing. There are countless stories of big businesses that became what they were through debt. They
            borrowed
            some cash, either from family, friends or financial institutions, and started a business that went on to
            create
            considerable wealth for its owners. In this case, they started with nothing, and ended up rich. There’s a
            great
            number of families that have a home because of mortgage. A car. Debt can be super awesome for the people who
            understand it and know how to use it. But just as debt gives, so it takes.</p>

        <p>LTCM was leveraged 30-1. This means that for every $100 the company invested, only about $3 was the
            investor’s
            money. The rest was borrowed from the banks. And the banks had incentive to do so. This was a big hedge
            fund,
            with big money, and wonderful returns. LTCM was good business for them. This level of leverage magnifies
            returns
            to the same tune. A 1% gain in the fund’s investments would mean an almost 33% gain in terms of the actual
            capital in the fund - the investor’s money. This might help to explain how the fund made the kind of returns
            it
            made in the first three years. And that’s the beauty of leverage. It magnifies results. The more of it you
            have,
            the higher the returns you can get. Provided the line goes up. If the line goes down, well, you’re fucked.
        </p>

        <p>Let’s imagine what a 1% loss in the investments would mean. Your investments are worth $99 now, but you still
            have to pay $100. The extra dollar comes from the $3 in actual cash you have, leaving you with $2. That’s a
            30%
            drop in your actual capital. And that’s the flip side of leverage. It magnifies returns on both sides. And
            given
            this example, the investments only need to go down by 3% or more for you to get wiped out. That’s what
            happened
            with LTCM. When the Asian financial crisis and the Russian defaults in the 1997-1998 occurred, it created a
            big
            enough shock for the company to get wiped out.</p>

        <h4>Remember, Only God Knows The Future</h4>

        <p>Assume a gambler has to bet on a coin toss. A coin that is, in the words of Thanos, perfectly balanced.
            There’s
            a 50% chance of heads or tails. Assume the first five tosses all come up as heads. The gambler - and the
            general
            population, if we’re honest - assumes that there’s a very high likelihood that the next toss comes up as
            tails.
            But here’s the thing, the odds are still the same - 50-50. The coin has no memory of the previous results.
            So
            while the gambler thinks betting on tails gives him/her a higher chance of winning, the chances remain the
            same.
            The same can be said of a gambler who keeps winning. The assumption is that they will keep winning. But the
            past
            is never an exact predictor of the future.</p>

        <p>I mentioned above that the firm had two Nobel Laureates in their ranks. Well, those two developed the models
            that the firm used to decide and measure their trades. These models tried to measure risk based on past data
            and
            a few assumptions, key among them the theory of efficient markets. But a few problems arise from this.
            First,
            past events predict the future roughly, not precisely. Nothing ever happens exactly as it did in the past.
            And
            adding to that, to get a good prediction of the future, even a rough one, you need representative data. LTCM
            used five years worth of data to develop their models. Five years of data in a sector that had existed for
            at
            least a hundred years. It didn’t even go as far as 1987, which would have helped the data account for market
            shocks. It was five years of the best data available. Not even close to representative. As a result, the
            risk
            that the firm accounted for was too low. And the shocks of 1997-1998 blew way past them easily.</p>

        <h4>A Person Is Smart. People Are Stupid.</h4>

        <p>There’s a reason that Economics is not considered a hard science, no matter how much we the practitioners try
            to
            make it one. That’s because central to all economic theory is the assumption - assumption being the key word
            -
            of rationality. We develop theories based on the assumption that people will act in a rational manner. But
            human
            behavior is very rarely rational, at least in the short term. People do the most irrational things in the
            short
            term, sometimes to their own detriment. Let’s not forget people rushing to buy tissue paper, of all things,
            when
            the lockdowns started. And most economic theory falls apart because of this assumption rarely holds. If you
            are
            to take a lesson from this, it’s that humans occupy two extremes - over-enthusiasm and under-enthusiasm.</p>

        <p>LTCM’s models were developed based on the assumption that markets are, for the most part, rational. But
            markets
            very rarely are. They operate on a relatively predictable pattern of boom and bust cycles. Over-enthusiasm
            and
            under-enthusiasm. People overreact to both bad news and good news. In the case of LTCM, the crises of
            1997-1998
            created a situation where prices started to fall. People holding those assets, in order to minimize losses,
            started selling a portion of their holdings. But because of this, those prices fell further, and the people
            holding the assets, again, in order to minimize losses, looked to further divest their holdings. This
            created a
            vicious self-repeating cycle that drove the assets down. LTCM, the biggest player in the assets most highly
            affected - bonds - couldn’t sell. They had the largest exposure. If they did, they’d practically kill the
            market. And so they held, and looked as the prices went past what their models had incorporated. A lot of
            the
            assets were still as sound then as the year before. This wasn’t an issue with the assets themselves. This
            was
            just fear.</p>

        <h4>Everything Goes To Shit during Bad Times.</h4>

        <p>When we say items are correlated, we mean that they behave in a similar manner, often affecting one another
            in
            many ways. Bitcoin was for a long time not correlated to the stock market, often behaving like it had a mind
            of
            its own. It’s price shot up several times that of the stock market, creating a FOMO reaction from a lot of
            people, including me. That was until the Federal Reserve of the US started raising interest rates. And the
            correlation went to one. All of a sudden, the entire crypto market was moving in sync with the stock market.
            In
            a shit market, everyone is selling. No one is safe.</p>

        <p>LTCM, at the start, was mostly dealing in bond arbitrage, the specialty of its founders. However, after some
            time, they went into options trading. They also entered into positions in foreign markets. All these markets
            were, for the most part, moving independently from each other. As such, this provided the unicorn of
            investing
            that is diversification. A bad day in one market would easily be covered by the other markets. But then the
            events of 1997/1998 happened, creating a shock strong enough to cause people to go into a frenzy. Selling
            pressure came from all fronts. First in the riskier investments such as the Russian bonds. But then this
            selling
            pressure hit the more secure bonds. And it soon spread to the stock markets. In Asia. In South America. In
            the
            US. Everything LTCM touched was selling off. They had missed an important rule. Markets are not correlated.
            But
            this only holds in good times. In bad times, correlations often go to one.</p>
