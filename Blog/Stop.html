        <p>There’s this dream. A recurrent dream I kept having a couple of years ago. In it, I see myself in a European
            monastery. How do I know I was in a European monastery? I just do. It’s one of those dream things where you
            just
            know something. I’m there because I’m hiding. Because I’m being hidden. The prevailing theory is that this
            is
            the
            only place where it won’t find me. It being the monster that’s after me. The people here assure me that this
            is
            the
            only place where I’ll be safe. And for the first time in a long time, this seems to be true. There is a
            lingering
            feeling of fear. Fear that the monster will find a way to me. Just as it has before. But I believe these
            people.
            But
            not long after this, I see myself standing on a hill, looking back at the monastery in the valley. It’s
            getting
            devoured by the monster - if you’ve seen the movie Dune, think <a
                href="https://youtu.be/GG-olXBQOdY?feature=shared" target="_blank">the sand
                worm</a>. The monastery, and every person in it, dies. And all I can do is
            run again.</p>

        <p>The monster in this dream seems to be linked in some way to me. This is another one of those dream things
            that
            I’m
            aware of. I’m aware that I’m running out of hiding places. I’ve ran halfway across the world, and it still
            finds
            its
            way to me.</p>

        <p>Stepping out of the dream a bit, a curious thing occurs to me. One thing that stands out to me about the
            dream is
            that I’m always running. I never actually stop. I never face the monster. And by doing so, I cause a lot of
            collateral damage. To those willing to take me in. To those sympathizing with my cause. I watch a whole
            monastery
            going down. And in that moment, all I can do is start running again, hoping I find somewhere safer. I never
            stop
            to
            face the fear. I’m too afraid of it devouring me.</p>

        <h4>The Harden Step Back</h4>

        <p>I’m about to make a sport reference, so please bear with me. I hope it will make sense later in the article.
        </p>

        <p>A couple of years back, James Harden caused a lot of controversy for a move that a lot of people thought was
            illegal. It was called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9GddRiKdXg" target="_blank">the Harden Step
                Back</a>. He’d
            dribble to just
            inside the three point line, fake a forward drive, but instead take two steps (sometimes three, hence the
            controversy) back outside the three point line and shoot. It was a predictable move. When you watch his
            marker,
            you
            can tell that he’s anticipating the step back. But there’s little to nothing the marker can do. So while it
            was
            predictable, it was reliable. So reliable that Harden was one of the best shooters for a couple of seasons
            in a
            row.
            So reliable that a lot of other players started copying the move. You’ll see the move a lot more today. Some
            players
            take a quick look down to make sure they are in the right place. The best ones know instinctively that they
            are
            in
            the right place.</p>

        <p>The thing about the move is that it offers more time and space to shoot. There can only be one or two markers
            covering the three point shooter, compared to shooting from the basket, where it is almost always crowded.
            And
            if
            you do make the shot, it offers more points to the team. To the point that this season, the most reliable
            predictor
            of which team wins a game is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tLzQ1ZC9Ko" target="_blank">which
                team scored more
                threes</a>. But to
            make the shot, you have to stop short of running at the basket, aim, and shoot.</p>

        <h4>Dazed and Confused</h4>

        <p>This is one of those articles that I almost didn’t want to put out. It’s from a personal experience. I’ve
            been
            debating whether this belongs here or in my journal. I’ve been asking myself where the line of oversharing
            is,
            and
            whether this crosses it. Maybe it does. But while going through this personal experience, I received what
            seemed
            like really simple advice at the time. But in hindsight, is really profound advice. Advice that I think
            everyone
            should hear.</p>

        <p>As I was experiencing the crisis, I didn’t know left from right, front from back. It was all chaos. And the
            chaos
            produced a lot of uncertainty. Uncertainty that led to fear. I am a big fan of uncertainty, just not within
            the
            circle that is me and the people I care for. I subscribe to the Jordan Peterson advice of <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8_gUmt0k8o" target="_blank">keeping your house in
                order</a>. For some weeks there, I was waking up dazed and confused, and
            I’d just stroll through the day in the same manner. I figured if I just kept running forward, it would all
            be
            okay.
            But it was getting worse. And it was taking a toll on me. On my sleep. On my concentration. On my ability to
            pay
            attention. I was afraid and anxious. Because for the first time in a while, the dream I had created for
            myself
            was
            in danger of disappearing. A dream that, until that point, was just something far off in my mind. An
            intangible
            thing. An unreal thing. I was scared that this thing that wasn’t real, that I had no assurance of getting,
            that
            I
            wasn’t owed, was going to be lost.</p>

        <h4>Take Stock</h4>

        <p>This continued until I had a meeting with someone vastly more experienced than I was. And he told me that in
            situations like this, uncertainty is the enemy. That in situations like this, instead of running forward
            blindly,
            sometimes what you need to do is take a step back, like Harden. Slow down, take stock. What information do I
            know
            for sure? What resources do I have at the moment? What can the information and resources I have at the
            moment do
            to
            help the situation? Who can I reach out to? What can I postpone? What can I get rid off? What can I write
            off?
            Where
            can I put my attention to yield the best return? What this looked like for me was taking a pen and paper,
            and
            asking
            myself a few of these questions. Asking yourself these questions does a lot to alleviate some of the
            uncertainty.
            Not all, but some. And it will pull back your stress levels to some extent. At least enough so that you can
            sleep.
            Because we do not fuck with sleep. What it did for me was make me realize that I was going to be fine. That
            I
            had
            set myself up to survive pretty well going forward. That my worst case scenario wasn’t something I couldn’t
            recover
            from. That, in the short run, nothing would have to change. And that I had a wonderful support system that I
            could
            fall back on if a black swan event wiped me out. Whatever happened, I was probably going to be fine.</p>

        <h4>Before You Jump</h4>

        <p>When your back is against the wall, I urge you to do the same. Slow down for a fucking minute, and take stock
            of
            what you have. If you really take the time to do so, you will realize that you have a lot. You just can’t
            see it
            because you are running blind. And yes, there might be someone reading this who has nothing, but to you I
            say,
            find
            something. Something that you care about. You’d have to be a psychopath to not have something to care about.
            And
            make that something your project going forward. Work on it as best as you can, as far out as you can. A lot
            of
            the
            richest people are people who come from pain, but found something they cared about. But please notice that I
            say
            find ‘something’ to care about. Not ‘someone’. This is an important point. People are not drugs.</p>

        <p>When you slow down and take stock, you’ll also realize a few things. Remember that one person who at one
            point
            you
            thought was the end all, be all for you? Imagine you got over him/her. Remember that situation that you
            though
            was
            going to be the end of you? Imagine you survived. Remember when you thought a certain amount of money was a
            lot.
            Imagine it’s not anymore. You don’t have to be religious to see miracles. And when you look at your life,
            there
            are
            going to be two or three miracles that you’ve already pulled. Confidence is proof. And when you take stock,
            you’ll
            see that you already have proof. You just need to remind yourself of this from time to time. For the most
            part,
            whatever it is that your facing, you’ll be fine.</p>
