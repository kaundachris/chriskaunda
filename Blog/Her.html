        <p><em class="intro">And so, an important question comes up. Who sets the standards?</em></p>

        <p>Every game has rules. If you’re good at the game, you play by the rules of the game. If you’re clever,
            you
            learn what rules to bend to get the outcome you want. And in life, there will be areas where the rules
            are
            in your favor, and areas where they aren’t. The really clever people don’t seem to mind either way. They
            bend whatever rules they can to get to where they want to get. That’s the essence of a great player. In
            today’s world, I see a lot of people complaining about how something is unfair. How a system is corrupt.
            We
            bring these moral and ethical arguments up. But in doing so, we fail to realize that the clever people
            use
            the system’s unfairness and corruption to get to where they want. And when it comes to feminism, I think
            the
            women that embody it are those who are great players. Those that achieved wonderful outcomes in a system
            rigged against them.</p>

        <h4>Beyonce</h4>

        <p>There’s a general level of respect Bey is given in the music industry and beyond. She is a superstar. She
            is
            a symbol of feminism for a lot of people. She is the epitome of ‘I get what I want.’ And that’s a theme
            that
            seem to have always existed with her. You only need to hear the stories (whether they are true or not is
            a
            debate for another day) of her <a
                href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/news/article/2001378848/kelly-rowland-describes-being-in-destinys-child-with-beyonce-as-torture">actions
                in Destiny’s
                Child</a>.
            She knew, from an early age, what she wanted. And she went for it. I recently watched the <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucz_pm3LX8">Baby
                Boy</a> video, and a couple of other videos from her early career.
            And I remember thinking one thing. She knew exactly what she was doing. I think that the music industry,
            especially for the black community, was generally male than it was female. In part because of the rap
            era
            led by Tupac and Biggie. Pop was mostly a white genre. And what do you do to stand out in a male
            dominated
            field and a white dominated genre? You use the unfair advantage you have. The one thing you have that no
            one
            else has.</p>

        <p>Bey was a young, black, very attractive woman. And she capitalized on it. Don’t get me wrong. There was a
            huge amount of talent. But many people have talent. Not many have looks. Watch any of those early
            videos,
            and you’ll see what I mean. Additionally, she did collaborations with some of the biggest male artists
            of
            the era. Jay Z. Sean Paul. Why? Because she understood market dynamics, and knew she needed to draw in
            the
            audiences of these male artists. She married arguably the biggest artist in hip-hop, without any
            publicity.
            Ironically, she drooped <a
                href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5R9a4t5t5O0IsznsrKPVro?si=fabc57a38a6d4f64">‘Single
                Ladies’</a> a couple of months
            later. She has kept her marital life relatively private. Outside of her music, she’s generally existed
            outside of the limelight, popping up only strategically. She’s never actually been vocal about women’s
            empowerment. That’s not to say she isn’t. But its always been in the subtext of what she does. In the
            subtext of what she does.</p>

        <h4>Angela Merkel</h4>

        <p>Angela is someone that I don’t think is talked about enough. She was the most powerful person in Europe
            for
            sixteen years. Sixteen years. And that’s in the male dominated field of power and politics. And she
            managed
            to get to the top. She ran the most powerful nation in Europe, and the fourth largest economy in the
            world.
            A country with a unique history of leaders. How did she get there? I can only assume by learning how to
            play
            the game. And ensuring she had the tools to play it. You don’t get to that point easily. It had to be
            what
            she wanted. Chief because I can only assume she faced a lot of misogyny along the way. If you look at
            her
            demeanor, you’ll notice that she’s not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewlXCyiG65c">traditionally
                feminine</a>. There’s something so powerful when you watched her
            navigating a room. You can tell that you were watching a master of their game. Always composed.
            Relatively
            drab in dressing. And I think that was her unfair advantage.</p>

        <p>By virtue of her character, she could command respect. Say what you want about femininity, but respect,
            especially in certain rooms, is commanded very differently. Is it unfair? Yes. Very. But that’s the game
            you’re playing. There hasn’t been any obvious occasion where she has been vocal about women empowerment.
            Why
            would she when she has shown you the way. As the saying goes, we lead by example, not instruction.</p>

        <p>I think her example has been adopted by a lot of people. We now have several leaders who are revered by
            the
            general public as a whole. Good examples include Jacinda Ardern (former New Zealand Prime Minister) and
            Ursula von der Leyen (President of the European Commission). Women who, I think, are feminist at heart.
            Women who quietly pave the way for the rest.</p>

        <h4>Rihanna</h4>

        <p>Rihanna, in my opinion, has some of the best ‘bad bitch’ anthems out there. Who can forget the classic
            ‘<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0NTMtAO2BV4tnGvw9EgBVq?si=1548de32623e4bbf">Bitch Better Have
                My Money.</a>’ A
            song that both guys and girls resonated with so much. And then there’s ‘<a
                href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5r67bGhYXZNqk2m2Wupfmu?si=789b0abed4ca43dd">Pour It
                Up</a>’ with its risqué music video.
            And my personal favorite,
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6t90Z9XkdsHD8xMxro6KRP?si=97c95c825b1a4576">‘[Consideration]’</a>
            with another
            icon in the making, SZA. She was recently in the news for the Vogue cover - an image considered a
            profound
            moment in today’s debate on gender roles. She is an icon. But even she played by the game of the
            industry.
            She followed the path that had been set by Beyonce. She was the bomb. And she knew it. And the people
            around
            her knew it. And they used this to her advantage. Most of the early videos were directed using a
            technique
            in the film industry called ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeSiwHnV5L0">the male gaze.</a>’
            And that’s done
            intentionally.
        </p>

        <p>Now whether that is in line with today’s feminist rhetoric is another question. But its what she needed
            to
            do to get to where she is. It was part of the game she was playing. And now she enjoys a relatively
            private
            life with a man who in my opinion, is and has been infatuated by her for a long time. And it seems to be
            a
            good thing. But you won’t find her in a march somewhere. She paved her own way. She’s set the example.
        </p>

        <h4>Radical Change</h4>

        <p>All through this article I’m basically advocating for quiet change. That is not to say that I don’t think
            radical change works. But radical change only occurs after decades of quiet change. Because it is quiet
            change that makes people malleable enough to accept radical change. Otherwise you face a lot of
            resistance.
            There is no clear boundary between women not wearing trousers and women wearing trousers. It seems like
            it
            happened overnight. But there had to be women who did it, from time to time, until the people around
            them
            considered it normal. There is no clear boundary between women not being in leadership and women being
            leaders. It must have took a small number of women, slowly making their way to the top, until it was
            considered the norm. The ones who create the most change aren't the vocal minority (minority here is
            used
            very intentionally). Its usually the silent majority. Look around, and there are women who have paved
            the
            way for you. Women who have earned their motorcycle patches. If you don’t believe me, consider where
            you’d
            be without you mum’s quiet effort.</p>
