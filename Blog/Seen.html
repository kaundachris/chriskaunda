        <p>The play is called ‘Death of a Salesman,’ aired in 1949. As the curtains fall, there is silence in the
            audience.
            Silence for a brief moment. A heartbeat. As if the people are taking in what they have just seen. Then,
            applause, as people stand up. But amidst that applause are men who remain seated. Men who, after the people
            pay
            more attention, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2DP-A6FhA0" target="_blank">are realized to be
                crying</a>. These
            men can’t stop
            crying. It is said that they are taken to hospital, still crying. The main character in the play - the
            salesman
            - had a devoted wife. Two sons. A house. Things that would be an accomplishment today. But he also had grand
            dreams. Dreams of what a successful salesman was. What a successful salesman ought to be. And with regards
            to
            these dreams, the salesman was none of these things. His sales numbers were shit. As a result, he had lost
            his
            job. He was borrowing money to keep up appearances. He was cheating on his wife. His sons were
            disappointments
            to him. Mainly because he placed those same grand ideas on his sons. And his sons rebelled against them.
            Against
            the ideas, not the man. And in the end, in order to leave something behind for his family, he takes his last
            drive into the abyss, so that they can get an insurance payout. A good one. And the salesman was no more. No
            one
            has ever been able to verify this story. But it’s a good story. As Hannibal says, all sorrows can be borne
            if
            you put them in a story.</p>

        <h4>The Desire to be Seen.</h4>

        <p>People post birthday messages to friends - and themselves - on their statuses, even though they have direct
            access to them. People do this, then complain that they have too many birthday messages to reply to. People
            post
            pictures of trips they had. They know that it doesn’t matter to the majority of the people who see the
            posts.
            But we want those people to see anyway. Whether implicitly or explicitly. Men get toys. Whether that be cars
            or
            watches. Whatever. Because toys are a signifier of status. And status is the easiest path towards access.
            Especially access to the elusive <a
                href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1fOkmYW3ZFkkjIdOZSf596?si=850d7dcdd1384810" target="_blank">cotton
                candy</a>. It’s the same reason women
            push out thirst traps - I won’t go into it, but y’all know exactly what the fuck I’m talking about. At the
            center of all the things we do, is the fundamental desire to be seen.</p>

        <p>And the funny thing is that this desire isn’t just aimed towards the opposite sex. It’s intra-sex too. Men
            flash
            their toys to other men just as much as they do to women. It earns us clout, with men and women equally.
            Status
            has benefits that far outstrip conquering Majin Buu. Women, I’ve been told, wear make-up for both the
            opposite
            sex and the pressures of their own sex. Being seen is not a men or women thing. It’s a people thing. It’s
            different and the same at the same damn time.</p>

        <h4>To be Seen Correct.</h4>

        <p>But it’s not enough to be seen. You have to be seen correctly. We all obsess over this. It’s why people - men
            especially - rarely show feelings. It’s a show of weakness. Not just to other men, but to women too (no
            matter
            what y’all say to the contrary). It’s because even if we do show feelings, people usually don’t have the
            tools
            to know what to do with them. Not men, because they haven’t been taught this. And not women, because she’s
            probably never been in this situation before - her dad was stoic, her brothers are too. And trust me, people
            will hate you for putting them in a situation where they don’t know what to do. And that’s too costly a
            situation for most people. There are only three situations where men are allowed to openly express emotion:
            at a
            funeral of a loved one, when his child is born, and maybe, maybe, when he gets married. <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGxW2toAvzc" target="_blank">Otherwise, he cries in
                private</a>.</p>

        <p>That’s why we don’t post pictures when we’ve just woken up. No. It has to be when we’re all perked up.
            Looking
            fine as fuck. Even if it means digging through photos from a year ago to repost. It’s why the beauty
            industry is
            so big - heck, Kylie’s a billionaire. It’s why the second richest guy in the world owns a luxury brand. Its
            why
            guys are getting their legs broken to be taller. Flashing their toys around, then complaining the women they
            get
            are superficial. Its why women are getting BBLs. Then spend the rest of their lives telling guys not to
            touch.</p>

        <h4>Of Relatives and Absolutes.</h4>

        <p>Absolutes exist only in the hard sciences. The temperature of space is absolute zero. Everything decays.
            Gravity
            is the curvature of space. These are absolutes that hold relatively well no matter the context. But anything
            that involves any kind of social structure is built on relatives. Because society, at its core, is governed
            by
            the rule of relatives. It’s how people are related to each other, whether through the color of their skin,
            or
            their geographical location. It’s how people relate to each other. Do they have shared beliefs. Maybe shared
            resources. Maybe shared interests. Unless you are a sociopath, or decide to fuck off into the cabin in the
            woods
            (which kind of makes you a sociopath), then all your interactions will be relative.</p>

        <p>Whatever part of the social hierarchy you find yourself in, you’ll never be a lone giant or a singular dwarf.
            The comparison game will always exist. And there will always be a desire towards more. We are social
            creatures.
            For us, everything has been, and always will be, relative. Men exist in a state of <a
                href="https://bestofsno.com/47713/features/the-silent-competition/" target="_blank">silent
                competition</a>. It’s covert. But it’s always there,
            no matter how much we pretend it isn’t. Toys are only awesome when only a few have them. If everyone has
            them,
            then it’s like the air we breathe. It’s there, but no one cares about it. We pretend not to care about
            status
            games. But even not caring is a status game in itself. Whether rich by a society’s standards, or poor by the
            same, we are all playing the game. We are all prisoners of relativity.</p>

        <h4>To be Seen as Important.</h4>

        <p>What’s the end game of all this wanting to be seen? Why huff and puff so much? I think, at the core, is that
            we
            are chasing the feeling of being needed. That’s it. To be needed. Because to be needed is to be seen. To be
            needed, then you have to be deemed important. Whether it’s to one person, to a group of people, or to a
            whole
            population, that is what is at the core. Maybe that’s why there is all this talk of the crisis of
            masculinity
            (I’m a perpetrator). Because for the first time in history, man is either being told or is realizing that he
            isn’t needed anymore. Not like he used to be needed before. Not like his father was. His role model is now
            considered toxic. He has no frame of reference for what to be. Maybe it’s why some of them are walking away.
            Maybe that’s why some are just bouncing around, causing the ballooning of single parent households. Not
            until he
            finds that one person who needs him. Wants him.</p>

        <p>Why do I post these articles to people who might barely care about them? Why do I put them on LinkedIn and my
            status? Knowing very well that there’s a chance that something I’ve said here might/will be used to crucify
            me
            in the future. Why have a blog, where I touch on controversy here and there, under my name? Why not use
            something ambiguous, so that it’s harder to trace back to me? Why? For the thin chance that I do something
            that
            is beyond me. For the slight chance that I do something that matters. That’s my grand idea. And maybe, that
            idea, like that of the salesman, is going to be the death of me.</p>
