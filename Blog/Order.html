            <p>Rules - written or unwritten - govern almost every facet of our lives. They govern what we say, how we
                act,
                what
                we can do, and how we should do those things. They permeate every facet of our lives. Break from these
                rules,
                and the consequences are painful. You’ll be jailed; cast out of society; discriminated against. These
                rules
                set
                the baseline for what we refer to as ‘normal.’ But here’s the thing about normal. It encourages
                sameness.
                Examine every group of people, and you’ll find that there’s a similarity in all of them. It can be in
                how
                they
                speak or how they dress. And not all people care for normalcy. There’s always a group of people who will
                not
                fit
                into the system. Not all people fit into the system. People drawn to chaos. There’s always a black swan.
                Even as
                we strive towards order, there’s a part of us that is drawn towards a certain level of chaos. And we
                need to
                feed this part of ourselves, lest we go mad. And the best way to achieve this is to watch people with
                the
                courage/ability/freedom to engage in chaos. To identify with them, and by doing so, to get out of
                normalcy
                once
                in a while.</p>

            <h4>Wallstreetbets</h4>

            <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank">Wallstreetbets</a> started as a
                community
                of people doing
                what could
                only be described as dumb stuff. My guess is that, at the start, this community was made up of people
                disillusioned to the unfairness of the systems we have built over the years - systems that were supposed
                to
                ensure the prosperity of all people. These we people stuck in jobs - or situations - they hated. People
                who
                just
                wanted a way out. And their solution was to risk it all, sometimes in one bet, even if it meant that
                they
                end up
                in complete ruin. It was niche. It was weird. And a select few loved it exactly for those reasons. And
                this
                community grew, until a critical point where they were <a
                    href="https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/money/a36395893/wallstreetbets-investment-fortunes-gamestop-inside-story/"
                    target="_blank">big
                    enough to cause
                    trouble</a>
                - to enter the mainstream.</p>

            <p>At this point, they gained attention from the general population. And a group of people started entered
                the
                fringes of the community - people who just wanted to watch. People who don’t have the courage to make
                such
                shots
                - maybe people with enough sense not to? If the subreddit was a sport, the first group - the risk takers
                -
                are
                what I describe as the players. The second group, are what I would call the spectators. People with
                ordinary
                lives, looking soA small sport of options trading - pretty niche - now has a community of 13 million
                people.
                They have entered finance conversations everywhere - even had one of its members <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3NUNoZPxvk" target="_blank">appear before the
                    congress</a>. They are now mainstream.</p>

            <h4>The World Cup</h4>

            <p>Football started as a working man’s sport. The first football teams were formed out of workers of
                industrial
                plants. Thing is, in every community, there’s a small group of people who come together to form teams
                where
                they
                can just meet after work and play their stresses away. Where people can get the adrenaline rush, banter
                away,
                and go back home to normalcy. And in the 19th century - a period of extreme labour requirements - maybe
                these
                groups of people wanted to have something to call their own. Something they enjoyed. And my guess is
                that it
                was
                a weird sport to many back then. And with <a href="https://www.footballhistory.org/" target="_blank">no
                    standard rules</a>
                to follow, you
                could just create your own. It was niche. It was weird. And a select few loved it exactly for those
                reasons.
                Contrast that too the multi-billion dollar sport it is today.</p>

            <p>This year’s world cup was something else. The main thread permeating the world cup commentary was ‘<a
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjhyYrB_cn8AhULhf0HHamuBmAQFnoECF0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fsoccer%2Ffifa-world-cup%2Fstory%2F4835721%2Fthe-world-cup-belongs-to-lionel-messi&usg=AOvVaw1i_pwrh0g_Or1FBtIvyhGm"
                    target="_blank">it
                    is
                    written in the
                    stars</a>.’
                Argentina’s journey to a world cup title was a dopamine hit many people hadn’t experienced before. And
                that
                final! But also interesting was watching people around the world, cheer (vehemently) for teams they
                would
                have
                previously had no affiliation for. It was watching men cry over people they had never met. It was
                watching
                people who previously had no nationalistic leanings turn into ardent supporters. I myself wanted Morocco
                in
                the
                final. Why? Because they are an African team. I had never thought about Morocco in this way. Ever. Until
                the
                world cup. Why wouldn’t I want an African team in the finals. So why did so many of us identify with
                people
                we
                know so little about? With people we could barely care about otherwise? Perhaps because its a novelty
                that I
                wouldn’t experience otherwise?</p>

            <h4>Formula 1</h4>

            <p>F1 has been a relatively niche sport. Not a lot of people cared for the sport that much. Including
                myself.
                Only
                a select few - mostly rich white people - cared for F1. In their world, where everyone could have
                everything
                and
                anything they wanted, how was anyone supposed to stand out? Competition and pride, that’s how. And so
                the
                sport
                was exclusive - for the most part - to either rich people or people of a certain background. It was
                always
                on
                the periphery. We’d hear names like Michael Schumacher, but only in passing. That was until the 2010’s,
                when
                a
                certain name started popping up. Lewis Hamilton. A black kid had made it in a white man’s sport, against
                all
                adversity. That was enough to get an entire group of people interested in the sport. And that, is the
                beginning
                of F1 going mainstream.</p>

            <p>I remember being transfixed by that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azzEnM6-Isk"
                    target="_blank">final qualifying
                    lap by
                    Max</a>
                in the 2021 season. The guy gave it his all. Even thousands of kilometers away, I could feel him
                throwing in
                everything he had - including his safety - to get that pole position. Its how close he was getting to
                the
                wall.
                There was no margin of safety for that lap. It was all or nothing. That was the most beautiful thing I’d
                seen in
                a long time - a man willing to risk his life for a glimpse of greatness. And I loved every second of it.
                And
                given how the sport exploded during that season, I’m guessing a lot of people around the world felt the
                same
                feeling. It reminded me of Ayrton Senna. Not a lot of people - even those familiar with the sport -
                recognize
                that name. It is with good reason.</p>

            <h4>We’re all fucked</h4>

            <p>I recently came across a video with an interesting title - <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DoaUyMGPWI" target="_blank">Fighting in the Age of
                    Loneliness</a>. While it was about a sport that I didn’t pay too
                much
                attention to - MMA - it was a beautiful exploration to why the sport - and other sports too - have such
                an
                appeal to specific groups of people. Its funny how we are the most connected generation in the history
                of
                mankind, yet the most lonely. How we have most of our needs are met - less people dying of diseases,
                hunger,
                etc. - yet are the most unhappy people to ever exist. We live in a world where standards of behaviour -
                and
                existence as a whole - are being set without our contribution or consent. Where corporations dictate
                what we
                can’t and can’t say. Where society has become unforgiving of mistakes. And in such a controlling
                society,
                who
                wouldn’t want to sit back on the weekend, and watch a group of men bash each other’s brains out. But the
                video
                ends with the most poignant closing statement I’ve heard in a while. Going mainstream will happen to
                everything
                you love. Nothing you like will go untouched, and it will be monetized into meaninglessness. This isn’t
                limited
                to the examples above. You’re fucked too.</p>
