        <p><em class="intro">What happens to the people on the wrong side of average?</em></p>

        <p>There’s something to be said about the connected nature of the world today. We’re able to see into the lives
            of
            our family and friends, even when separated. We’re able to keep tabs on people for long periods of time -
            even
            people we shouldn’t be keeping tabs on. It allows us to look into the lives of people we’d never have access
            to
            even twenty years ago. Its amazing that normal people can interact with Elon or Jeff on Twitter. We get to
            see
            what they are thinking and doing, whether good or bad. It shows us what’s possible. We’re able to see people
            completely transform their lives for the better. And that gives a lot of people hope to push on. To try new
            things. To take risks. But I think there’s a dark side to all of this. And its centered around what I think
            is a
            growing sense of loneliness for a world that is supposed to be constantly connected and interacting. This
            hope,
            created by seeing random cases of success - and I use the word ‘random’ very purposefully - is creating a
            state
            of discontent to this generation. A generation that has been brought up in what is the equivalent of a
            cocaine-level dopamine environment, where everything can - and in this generations’ opinion, should - be
            gotten
            at the flick of the thumb. We aim for the extraordinary without realizing that most likely than not (and I’m
            sorry for bursting your bubble here) we’re destined to be ordinary. Warning though: this is going to be a
            bleak
            one.</p>

        <h4>Average</h4>

        <p>Average. Its a term people seem averse to these days. We try and run away from it. As hard as we can. We put
            tremendous amount of energy to not be close to it. We work our asses off, so that we can afford the above
            average stuff. We dress well, so that we don’t look like the average Joe. Average is invisible. And no one
            wants
            to be invisible. Not in this world of hyper visibility. Not in the world of social media, where everyone
            thinks
            they have a worthwhile opinion, and everyone thinks they have the right to be heard. But thing is,
            statistically
            speaking, for everything you can think of, there will always be an average. Whether that be wealth and
            possessions, happiness, number of children. You name it. There’s an average for it. A state around which
            everything settles. In chaos theory, its called an attractor. If we, for example, push everyone’s wealth up,
            the
            average will go up with it. You will be wealthier in absolute terms, but comparatively, your in the same
            place.
            You’re running as fast as possible, to stay in the same place.</p>

        <h4>Regression To The Mean</h4>

        <p>The world we live in today doesn’t seem to reward average. It only seems to care about the extra-ordinary
            (maybe
            it always has, and I’m complaining about a non-issue here). Look around the manosphere and you’ll here stuff
            like ‘the high value man,’ and ‘sigma/alpha male status.’ And we go after it without realizing that this
            kinds
            of people are about 1% of the population. That’s a really small subset of people. And our assumption is that
            they worked their way to their positions. Most likely than not, these guys were born with a silver spoon in
            their mouths. Those who worked their way to that top 1% are probably 1% (of that population, or .01%). And
            you
            have to attribute a huge amount of luck to them actually getting there. There’s a very high probability that
            you
            work your ass off and never get within touching distance. And getting there - on the off chance that you do
            -
            requires a huge amount of sacrifice, especially if you don’t have a silver spoon in your mouth. It requires
            that
            you put your head down and work. Mohammed Ali is famous for saying that if you can avoid the clubs and the
            parties and the girls, and be home at 9 by yourself, you’ll succeed. That’s a mostly lonely life. By the
            time
            you get to where you want to be, you’re Leonardo DiCaprio, always looking for the next pretty young thing to
            kill time with. He’s never alone, but he sure as hell seems lonely to me.</p>

        <h4>Wrong Side of Average</h4>

        <p>And then there’s the other side of the coin - the ladies - who want a high value man. That same 1% I’ve been
            talking about. But again, for a man to be there at our young age, he has to have a silver spoon in his
            mouth. If
            he doesn’t, then more likely than not, he’s old. Probably already with a family. And that high value man
            that
            you want? He wants a woman that’s in the 1%. And as the number indicates, most of us are not in that subset
            of
            people. You keep on waiting for this man, a man who might never show up, while ruining relationships with
            people
            who care. So that leaves 99% of both men and women being relatively over looked. This 99% of men and women
            are
            bound to settle with each other. To lead an ordinary, average life. The one thing that group of people has
            been
            running from. And that is a hotbed of resentment. Where we subordinate responsibilities to whoever is more
            willing to do them. Because what’s the point. Where mum raises the kids when dad can’t. Where dad raises the
            kids when mom can’t. Where grandma raises the kids when both mum and dad can’t. Where the state raises the
            kids
            if grandma can’t. And the streets raise those kids when the state can’t.</p>

        <h4>The Climb Back</h4>

        <p>We see this hopeless situation - the struggle for extra-ordinary - occurring everywhere around us. We feel
            its
            insidious presence seeping into our souls. Its in us working Monday to Friday, drinking over the weekend,
            and
            starting the cycle again. You hate your job. But you’ll work at it for the off chance of success - whatever
            that
            looks like to you. And you soon realize that the little level of extra-ordinary you’ve achieved in your life
            has
            a cost. And because you can’t go back to ordinary, you keep slaving away. You soon realize that you’ll spend
            most of your adult life not with your wife. Not with your kids. But with your colleagues. You realize that
            you
            know more about that desk mate at work than you do your kids. Than you do your wife. Why do you think
            workplace
            affairs exist? But what does that mean for a generation that is always switching jobs, and therefore can’t
            form
            any long-lasting relationships. What does that mean for a generation that conflates social media for an
            actual
            interaction. This system doesn’t allow for meaningful connection. Just fleeting moments. We are lonely, even
            as
            we have people around us. People laugh together, but if you take a moment to look at their eyes as they do,
            you
            realize there’s nothing there. As J. Cole says, ‘most of these people will hang themselves. Just give them a
            rope and see.’</p>
