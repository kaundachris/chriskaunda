        <p>A video is going viral on the internet. Its a violent one, so its moving through Telegram and WhatsApp. It
            security footage of a street. Its not immediately clear where. The camera, with a wide field of view, shows
            he
            stranger walking past a group of young men. The group has a bunch of bags with them, and they seem to be
            heavy.
            It seems the stranger bumps into one of them, almost making both fall over. They guy he bumped into - let’s
            call
            him John Doe - turns and says something to him. The stranger turns and looks at them. John Doe says
            something
            again, this time looking pissed. He puts the bag he’s carrying down, and takes a step towards the stranger.
            The
            stranger glances at the bag John Doe has set on the ground, then glances at the bags the rest of the crew
            are
            carrying. The stranger now turns his whole body towards John Doe. John Doe looks back at his crew. One guy
            says
            something to him. Another says something. Then John Doe pulls up his shirt and pulls what seems like a gun,
            taking aim at the stranger.</p>

        <h4>The Embrace</h4>

        <p>The stranger, by some miracle, reacts faster than John Doe. He jumps to his left side, then lunges at John
            Doe.
            What happens next is nothing short of messy. People running in and out of frame, guns pointed haphazardly.
            Muzzle flashes every time a shot is taken. Guys lying in a pool of blood. But at the end of it, we see the
            stranger struggling to walk into frame again, exhausted and likely injured. He walks to one of the guys
            lying
            there and kneels down. They seem to be talking. They then embrace each other for a while, both seemingly
            crying.
            The stranger then picks up a gun, and points it to the heart of the crew member. We see the crew member
            collapse
            to the ground. The stranger stays fixed there for a while, looks up to the sky, then collapses.</p>

        <h4>The News Cycle</h4>

        <p>A few hours later, all the news stations in the country switch to a briefing from the state house. The CS for
            internal Security gives a prepared statement in which she notifies the country that there was a failed
            terrorist
            attack in the last few hours. They are unsure as to whether there are other attacks on the way, but they
            assure
            the people that they are doing everything they can to protect the people. The CS institutes restrictions on
            movement in and out of the attack area, and bumps security in a bunch of popular and high population venues
            within a certain radius. Reporters ask whether the viral video doing rounds was related to the attack. The
            CS
            confirms that it was, but refuses to give further comments.</p>

        <h4>The Hero</h4>

        <p>Over the course of the week, news emerges that the stranger singlehandedly stopped what would have been a
            devastating terrorist attack on a popular mall. They apparently had a large amount of artillery, including
            machine guns, grenades, flashbangs and other weapons. All the terrorists were killed in a fierce fight
            between
            the stranger and the terrorist. He was apparently shot, but the shot wasn’t fatal, and he was recovering
            swiftly. All the news stations seem keen to interview the stranger. The state house is lining up an award
            for
            his service to his country. The president gives a powerful speech on the country’s devotion to fighting the
            evil
            that comes against the country. Profiles are carried out on the stranger. Who is he? What are his
            motivations?
            Why would he risk his life like that? Why can’t more people be like him? Most religious people acknowledge
            the
            power of God. He was there for a reason. It was God’s plan that he’d stop that heinous act from happening.
            People from a certain religious background start getting profiled. Chastised. Blamed. They assert that it
            might
            have been THEIR God’s plan that the attack not happen. But no. Credit goes to one God, and not the other.
            And
            then the news breaks. The stranger isn’t in hospital. He has disappeared into the ether.</p>

        <h4>The Sightings</h4>

        <p>Hospital surveillance shows the stranger getting a visit from a friend. A few hours after the friend leaves,
            the
            stranger strolls out of hospital in plain clothes and a cap, and disappears. There’s backlash against the
            hospital staff for their laxity. There’s backlash against security for their incompetence. He was under the
            government’s protection. His life no longer belonged to him. It belonged to the state. But attention is
            always
            fleeting. And after about two weeks, the noise has died down somewhat. People have gone back to their lives.
            The
            mania has diminished. But there are sightings. Given how much the stranger’s face was splattered across the
            media, it’s hard for him to hide. People claim to have seen him in different parts of the country. And this
            sort
            of starts a wild goose chase. News stations want to be the first to interview him. Not because he’s a hero.
            But
            because he’d be big news. And big news is good for business. But the most credible sightings were also the
            most
            uncomfortable ones.</p>

        <p>There were claims from a large number of people that he was sighted headed into the one part of the country
            few
            head into. He was headed, it seemed, into terrorist territory. There were people who claimed to have been in
            a
            bus with him. They say he was aloof. Indifferent. Even when people from the community threatened his life,
            his
            demeanor didn’t change. There were people who claimed to have given him a lift. One credible source emerged
            -
            the guide. He, on the condition of anonymity, claimed to know exactly where he was going. Exactly what he
            was
            looking for. The stranger was apparently on a journey into the abyss. Few people were allowed into where he
            was
            headed, him being among them. So he offered to be his guide. To be his grim reaper. To guide his soul into
            hell.</p>

        <h4>The Hero’s End</h4>

        <p>But the thing about these sightings, is that most of them aren’t reported by mainstream media. These are only
            seen or discussed in the far reaches of the internet. In bars while people are drunk watching games. In
            barbershops and salons. In homes, with hushed tones. It isn’t discussed out loud. Because he is supposed to
            be
            the hero of the story. The man who the powers that be placed him in that specific place, in that specific
            moment. The media is ordered to shut any unfit stories down. This is a national security matter now. His
            family
            is given the award by the state in his absence. Its a nice family. A bit tired - they seem to not be
            sleeping
            well. But a good family nonetheless. The kind of people that a story can be built around. He isn’t the man
            that
            killed a bunch of people. He’s the man that saved the country. That gave it hope for the better. A good
            story
            needs a good ending. And a hero’s story needs a hero’s end.</p>

        <p>But the legend still continues. And as the legend goes, he was headed to the community that the terrorist he
            embraced belonged to. Was it because he had a message from their son? Maybe. But its said he went there for
            one
            reason and one reason only. A son for a son. It’s said they wouldn’t do it. It was the easy way out for him.
            He
            had to live with what he had done. He was welcomed. He was fed. And when the time came, he was asked to
            leave.
            He attracted too much attention. Attention they didn’t want. And so he disappeared again. Apparently looking
            for
            death.</p>
