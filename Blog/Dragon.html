            <p>Running uphill sucks. I hate every second of it. Hate it. If you ever thought you hated someone, try
                running
                uphill. You’ll realize that you hate them a lot less than you hate running uphill. They become a lot
                more
                tolerable the next time you see them. Because you know that there’s something you hate more. And yet I
                do
                it.
                Three times a week. Two and a half kilometers. Seven and a half in total each week, five of which are
                spent
                running uphill. Why do I do it? I have a belief that most people who work out regularly, and do so
                outside
                of
                social media, do it because it represents something to them. Something that is not tied to the workout
                itself.
                When they do it, they are tapping into something internal. Something that only makes sense to them.
                That’s
                what
                makes them consistent. Its not the gains. The gains inevitably slow down after some time. The body is an
                adaptive machine. To continue past that point, it has to be something else.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, when I’m running, I meet another runner. She hates running just as much as I do. I can see it
                in
                her
                face. And yet she does it. I have my reason for doing it. I wonder what her reason is. <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOSEGYBy8d8" target="_blank">Running
                    sucks</a>. And yet I do it anyway.</p>

            <h4>Praying</h4>

            <p>I’m not religious, or spiritual. Whatever you want to call it. There’s a big reason for that. I might put
                it
                here someday. But the gist of it is that I was going through something when I was younger. Something
                that
                only
                God could explain. That only he could answer. And so I asked. And asked. And asked. All I ever got was
                silence.
                So at some point I said ‘well, fuck you too.’ And that was that. My stance has changed a lot since then.
                But
                Christianity and religion as a whole just doesn’t work for me. Its like getting back with that ex. Its
                never
                really the same. Saying this, some people lose their shit. Its inconceivable to them that someone has a
                differing view to the thing they hold precious. <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_perseverance" target="_blank">And I don’t blame
                    them</a>. Challenge something I fundamentally believe and I’ll
                react the same way. But they also people assume a lot. They assume that I don’t have faith. They assume
                faith is
                exclusive to the pious. That faith is exclusive to Christianity.</p>

            <p>I seen enough to know that there is no assurance in life. This world doesn’t owe me shit. My life could
                get a
                lot worse. A lot worse. But I continue, hoping that it gets a lot better. Hoping. If I didn’t believe in
                that
                slim chance, why would I go on? And isn’t that what faith is? Knowing the endless possibilities, most of
                which
                are bad, but hoping for the best? And truth is, I pray. I pray a lot. Its not the traditional prayer
                that we
                are
                taught since we were children. Its a little different. But I do pray. I know all I’ll hear back is
                silence.
                And
                yet I do it anyways.</p>

            <h4>Loving</h4>

            <p>Love can be a lot of pain. A lot. Especially when you’re in your twenties, when the pressure to settle
                down
                hasn’t hit full gear, and there is no urgency to do so. Love involves giving someone your time, your
                energy,
                sometimes for nothing in return. No reciprocation. No appreciation. This especially in a world where
                gender
                roles are shifting, and no one knows exactly who or what they are supposed to be in a relationship. It
                involves
                a lot of relationships that end abruptly, with little to no explanation. This can be that boyfriend.
                That
                girlfriend. It can also be that friend you’ve had for ages - love isn’t exclusive to lovers. It involves
                people
                being complete assholes with the people who love and care for them. It involves battling loneliness when
                the
                world around us seems to be doing great. Awesome even. Its wanting to be loved, even if it means
                sacrificing
                who
                you are, for that fleeting moment. That fleeting feeling. That someone cares for you. Its giving
                yourself to
                someone, hoping that it lasts. But most of us have had four five relationships with a person who was
                supposed to
                be ‘the one.’ And every time it ends, it hurts. It fucking hurts. And it does for a long time. And yet,
                we
                do
                it. We let ourselves be vulnerable. We let ourselves be seen. <a
                    href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm" target="_blank">"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in
                    the
                    midst
                    of wolves. Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves.”</a> The
                world is full of snakes. I know it. Probably better than you do. But you know what? I’ll play anyways.
            </p>

            <h4>Fighting</h4>

            <p>A lot of us got emotional (read ‘cried’) when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx0wvv3RclY"
                    target="_blank">Hodor</a>
                (Game of
                Thrones) died. I loved that they never bothered to explain why he was who he was until it mattered.
                Those
                last
                moments served to give context as to who he was. But he knew who he was. He knew for a long time. Since
                he
                saw
                Bran in his teenage years. He knew. It didn’t have to make sense to anyone else. It just had to make
                sense
                to
                him. ‘Hodor.’ That’s all he said. He knew the people around him wouldn’t understand what he was saying,
                or
                why
                he was saying it. He said it anyways.</p>

            <p>Few people have watched the rocky movies here. And while I watched it when I was younger, I didn’t really
                start
                resonating with it until I was an adult. It never made sense to me before. The guy gets hit pretty bad.
                And
                every time he hits the ground, he gets back up to get hit again. And again. And again. And the guy loses
                in
                the
                end. What the fuck is that. And he seems to be celebrating. He seems hyped. He seems to think he’s
                capable
                of
                anything now. And as I grow older, I understand. In his world, he is capable of anything now. Apollo,
                his
                opponent in the fight, puts it best. “Man, I won, but I didn’t beat him!” He knew he was going to lose.
                The
                movie makes it clear from the beginning. He fought anyways.</p>

            <p>There’s a picture of a guy at the end of an MMA fight. The look on this guy’s face says it all. He looks
                tired,
                but relieved. It was over. He was out of hell. And that seemed to be everything to him. Sixty six
                headshots
                in
                the second round. That's how much this guy got hit. A headshot every five seconds. This was not going
                well
                for
                him. Going into the third round, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43_hdMmWukU"
                    target="_blank">his
                    coach dropped all
                    decorum.</a>
                "YOU GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES OF HELL! YOU UNDERSTAND ME SON! FIVE MINUTES OF HELL!," the coach shouted at
                him.
                And
                the guy went out, got hit thirty five more times. A hundred and one headshots, in a span of ten minutes.
                And
                he
                lost the fight. For the rest of your life, go out, touch gloves, and fight.</p>
