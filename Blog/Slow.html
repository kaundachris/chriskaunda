        <p>What’s the best way to invest? It’s a question I’ve gotten a lot over the past year. And it’s a question
            that I’ve really struggled answering. A major reason I’ve struggled answering it is because most people
            who
            ask this question expect a quick and simple answer. They expect the existence of a trick that if they
            can
            implement, there’ll be instant success. But if there was, I’d be rich, wouldn’t I? And there’d be a lot
            more
            wealthy people, wouldn’t there? Another reason is that most people think that this is a good question to
            ask. But this question lacks something important. It doesn’t really <a
                href="https://alleninvestments.com/riskandreward/the-importance-of-context/" target="_blank">provide
                context</a>. And context matters a lot
            when it comes to money. Using an analogy my sister gave me, before a doctor prescribes anything to you,
            they
            ask a bunch of questions to get a clear understanding of your situation. Its the same with investments.
            I’d
            need to understand a bunch of thing about you and your situation before I give you any advice. Another
            reason is that people will ask questions because <a
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-being-fooled-fake-progress-richard-angel-" target="_blank">it
                feels like
                progress</a>. ‘If I know how to
            get wealthy, then it’s just a matter of actioning it when the time comes.’ ‘I’m not wealthy now because
            I
            don’t have the resources. But at least I know how to get wealthy.’ But asking and actioning are two very
            different things. And doing is a lot harder than asking.</p>

        <h4>Spend Less Than You Make</h4>

        <p>Save. This is the one simple advice I’d give to anyone looking to create sustainable wealth. It is
            simple.
            It is boring. It is unsexy. And because of this, most of you are going to completely ignore this advice.
            If
            there ever was to be a one size fits all suggestion, it is this one. Save. You don’t even need to bother
            about where to put that money. About where to invest it. Just get in the habit of putting something
            aside
            for a rainy day. It doesn’t matter how much. Just have something on the side that you do not touch. Do
            that
            consistently over a year. Yeah. Just a year. It seems easy. But in my experience, its the easy stuff
            that
            turns out to be hard. And when it comes to building wealth, outside of the few outlier cases (trust me,
            they
            are few. Don’t let the constant coverage of wealthy people fool you into thinking it is the norm),
            discipline in saving is probably the single biggest factor in many of the success stories out there.</p>

        <h4>The Psychology of Money</h4>

        <p>If you can do this one thing consistently, then I know you can look at your investment portfolio take a
            temporary hit, and not panic. I know you can put money into an investment, and let it do its thing. I
            know
            you can be patient. Why am I spouting things to do with psychology and not finance? It’s because the
            more
            you know about finance, the more you understand that it has <a
                href="https://calvinrosser.com/notes/psychology-of-money-morgan-housel/" target="_blank">everything to
                do with human
                psychology</a>. And if you are able to
            manage your own psychology, you’ll be able to manage your money. And the chances of you creating wealth
            increases exponentially. My parent put money aside, and when the time came, they bought their own land,
            and
            built a mabati house. They chose to leave stone walls, and go live in a mabati house. Because they
            couldn’t
            stand giving so much money every month to the landlord. And they used that rent saving to build a house.
            The
            house I call home now. There’s another couple who gave me a funny story. They were saving up money for
            something entirely different. But then an opportunity came up, and all that money they’d saved up, they
            used
            to buy a pick-up, that served to enhance that opportunity. They say that pick-up has put their kids
            through
            school.</p>

        <p>If you can spend less that you make across your entire working life, you’ll be better off than 85% of the
            population.</p>

        <h4>Earn More or Cut</h4>

        <p>And yes, I know some of you are going off saying ‘I don’t make enough to save! I can barely cover my
            expenses!’ Call me ignorant, but someone struggling, really struggling, doesn’t have a smartphone or a
            computer, and bundles to read this article. Chances are, if you’re reading this, you probably can. But
            let’s
            entertain this rebuttal. If this is your situation, then there’s only <a
                href="https://econation.one/blog/earn-more-or-spend-less/" target="_blank">one of two
                solutions</a> really. The first, and obviously harder
            one,
            is to raise your income as soon as you can. If you are in a position to negotiate your salary, do so as
            soon
            as you can. Create a case for why you deserve more. Do some research on market rates. Maybe look for
            another
            job if your current one isn’t meeting your needs. Spruce up your CV. Network. If not, start a side
            hustle.
            What side hustle? I don’t know. You know your situation better than I do. But find something. Do
            something.
            Anything to raise your income level. The other option, which is admittedly a lot easier, is to cut your
            expenses. Yes. Downgrade your lifestyle. This option has immediate impact. And it can be done while
            exploring option one. This is ideally the one you should start with. But I know, and you know, that this
            is
            not an option for most people.</p>

        <h4>Slow and Unsexy</h4>

        <p>The truth is that creating wealth is <a href="https://jamesclear.com/habit-creep" target="_blank">slow and
                unsexy</a>.
            Finance is
            not
            fun. There’s a reason I haven’t written about it in a while. And it is not meant to be fun. Every time
            finance has gotten exciting, it has ended up causing damage. Every time something exciting has come up,
            it
            has ended up crushing and burning. People want to make money. And whenever an easy way to make money
            comes
            up, people jump on it (basic human psychology), and it becomes a bubble that bursts sooner or later. If
            you
            got in with the hype, you’ll get burnt. A good example is that I’ve lost money with crypto. Real wealth
            is
            built slowly over decades. It’s saving slowly over time to take your kids to good schools. It’s saving
            over
            time too buy that piece of land. It’s leaving that piece of land over ten years, only it find it has
            tripled
            in price. It’s buying a stock and forgetting about it for 11 months - until they send you dividends -
            and
            then forgetting about it for another year. Only to find out it has doubled in price.</p>

        <p>If you’ve read ‘<a href="https://briefer.com/books/millionaire-door" target="_blank">The Millionaire Next
                Door</a>’ you
            know that
            most
            of the millionaire families are actually the biggest penny pinchers. You know that most of them are in
            their
            fifties. Not in their twenties or thirties. You know that they started a local business long ago. A
            mostly
            boring one. It’s the car dealer. The hardware owner. They are your regular Joes. They have a nice house,
            but
            not the nicest in the neighborhood. They have a nice car, but not the nicest in the neighborhood. Their
            kids
            are in private schools. Maybe abroad. But they still have a budget, or at least keep track of their
            expenses. Even with all they have.</p>
